<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subsequent little Work owes its rise and
progress to very trifling circumstances.</p>

<p>In the early part of my life, having read many
books in favour of Ghosts and Spectral Appearances,
the recollection remained so strong in my
mind, that, for <i>years</i> after, the dread of phantoms
bore irresistible sway. This dread continued till
about my twenty-third year, when the following
simple affair fully convinced me, how necessary it
was <i>thoroughly</i> to investigate <i>every thing</i> that
tended to supernatural agency, lest idle fear
should gain a total ascendancy over my mind.</p>

<p>About this period, I had apartments in a large
old-fashioned country mansion. From my bed-chamber
was a secret door leading to a private
staircase, which communicated with some of the
lower rooms. This door was fastened both within
and without; consequently all fear of intrusion
from that quarter was entirely removed. However,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>at times, I could not help ruminating on the
malpractices that <i>might</i> have been committed by
evil-disposed persons, through this communication;
and "busy meddling fancy" was fertile in
conjuring up imaginary horrors. Every thing,
however, was quiet, and agreeable to my wishes,
for some months after my arrival. One moonlight
night, in the month of June, I retired to my
bed, full of thought, but slept soundly till about
one o'clock; when I awoke, and discovered, by the
help of the moon which shone full in my room, a
tall figure in white, with arms extended, at the
foot of my bed. Fear and astonishment overpowered
me for a few seconds; I gazed on it
with terror, and was afraid to move. At length I
had courage to take a <i>second</i> peep at this disturber
of my rest, and still continued much alarmed, and
irresolute how to act. I hesitated whether to
speak to the figure, or arouse the family. The
first idea I considered as a dangerous act of heroism;
the latter, as a risk of being laughed at,
should the subject of my story not prove supernatural.
Therefore, after taking a <i>third</i> view of the
phantom, I mustered up all my resolution, jumped
out of bed, and boldly went up to the figure,
grasped it round and round, and found it incorporeal.
I then looked at it again, and felt it again;
when, reader, judge of my astonishment&mdash;this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
ghostly spectre proved to be nothing more than a
large new flannel dressing-gown which had been sent
home to me in the course of the day, and which
had been hung on some pegs against the wainscot
at the foot of my bed. One arm accidentally
crossed two or three of the adjoining pegs, and
the other was nearly parallel by coming in contact
with some article of furniture which stood
near. Now the mystery was developed: this
dreadful hobgoblin, which a few minutes before I
began to think was an aërial being, or sprite, and
which must have gained admission either through
the key-hole, or under the door, turned out to be
my own garment. I smiled at my groundless fears,
was pleased with any resolution, returned light-hearted
to my bed, and moralized nearly the whole
of the night on the simplicity of a great part
of mankind in being so credulous as to believe
every idle tale, or conceive every noise to be a
spectre, without first duly examining into causes.</p>

<p>This very trifling accident was of great service
to me as I travelled onward through life. Similar
circumstances transpired. Screams, and shades,
I encountered; which always, upon due investigation,
ended in "trifles light as air."</p>

<p>Nor did the good end here. My story circulated,
and put other young men upon the alert, to
guard against similar delusions. They likewise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
imparted to me their ghostly encounters, and
those I thought deserving of record I always committed
to writing; and, as many of them are well
authenticated facts, and both instructive and
amusing, they form a part of the volume now
presented to the Public.</p>

<p>The other stories are selected from history, and
respectable publications; forming in the whole, I
hope, an antidote against a too credulous belief in
every village tale, or old gossip's story.</p>

<p>Though I candidly acknowledge to have received
great pleasure in forming this Collection,
I would by no means wish it to be imagined, that I
am sceptical in my opinions, or entirely disbelieve
and set my face against all apparitional record.
No; I do believe that, for certain purposes, and
on certain and all-wise occasions, such things
<i>are</i>, and <i>have been</i> permitted by the Almighty;
but by no means do I believe they are suffered to
appear half so frequently as our modern ghost-mongers
manufacture them. Among the various
idle tales in circulation, nothing is more common
than the prevalent opinion concerning what is generally
called a <i>death-watch</i>, and which is vulgarly
believed to foretel the death of some one in the
family. "This is," observes a writer in the
Philosophical Transactions, "a ridiculous fancy
crept into vulgar heads, and employed to terrify<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
and affright weak people as a monitor of approaching
death." Therefore, to prevent such
causeless fears, I shall take this opportunity to
undeceive the world, by shewing what it is, and
that no such thing is intended by it. It has obtained
the name of death-watch, by making a
little clinking noise like a watch; which having
given some disturbance to a gentleman in his
chamber, who was not to be affrighted with such
vulgar errors, it tempted him to a diligent search
after the true cause of this noise, which I shall
relate in his own words.</p>

<p>"I have been, some time since, accompanied
with this little noise. One evening, I sat down by
a table from whence the noise proceeded, and laid
my watch upon the same, and perceived, to my
admiration, that the sound made by this invisible
automaton was louder than that of the artificial
machine. Its vibrations would fall as regular,
but much quicker. Upon a strict examination, it
was found to be nothing but a little beetle, or spider,
in the wood of a box." Sometimes they are
found in the plastering of a wall, and at other
times in a rotten post, or in some old chest or
trunk; and the noise is made by beating its head
on the subject that it finds fit for sound. "The
little animal that I found," says the gentleman,
"was about two lines and a half long, calling a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
line the eighth part of an inch. The colour was
a dark brown, with spots somewhat lighter, and
irregularly placed, which could not easily be
rubbed off." It was sent to the publisher of the
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>Some people, influenced by common report,
have fancied this little animal a spirit sent to admonish
them of their deaths; and, to uphold the
fancy, tell you of other strange monitors altogether
as ridiculous. Though, as I before observed,
I do not deny but the Almighty may employ unusual
methods to warn us at times of our approaching
ends, yet in general, such common
and unaccountable tales are mere nonsense,
originating from want of a proper investigation,
and kept alive by an infatuated delight in telling
strange stories, rendered more ridiculous by recapitulation.
How charmingly does our poet
Thomson touch upon this subject&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"Meantime the village rouses up the fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, well attested, and as well believ'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard solemn, goes the goblin story round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till superstitious horror creeps o'er all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How cautious then ought parents and guardians
to be over their children, and the young people
committed to their charge. For, says an elegant
writer, the superstitious impressions made upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
their minds, by the tales of weak and ignorant
people in their infancy; a time when the tender
mind is most apt to receive the impressions of
error and vice, as well as those of truth and virtue,
and, having once received either the one or the
other, is likely to retain them as long as it subsists
in the body. All these deplorable follies
proceed from wrong and unworthy apprehensions
of God's providence, in his care of man, and government
of the world. Surely no reasonable
creature can ever imagine, that the all-wise God
should inspire owls and ravens to hoot out the elegies
of dying men; that he should have ordained
a fatality in numbers, inflict punishment without
an offence; and that being one amongst the fatal
number at a table, should be a crime (though
contrary to no command) not to be expiated but
by death! Thus folly, like gunpowder, runs in a
train from one generation to another, preserved
and conveyed by the perpetual tradition of tattling
gossips.</p>

<p>I now conclude this Introduction; and, in the
following pages, shall present my readers with
some admirable Essays on the subject by eminent
writers: and a Collection of Stories will follow,
which, I trust, will not only entertain, but likewise
convince the <i>thinking</i> part of mankind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
the absurdity in believing every silly tale without
first tracing the promulgation to its original
source; for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2><span class="xsm">AN</span><br />
<span class="lg1">ESSAY</span><br />
<span class="xsm">ON</span><br />
GHOSTS AND APPARITIONS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no folly more predominant, in the
country at least, than a ridiculous and superstitious
fear of ghosts and apparitions. Servants, nurses,
old women, and others of the same standard of
wisdom, to pass away the tediousness of a winter's
evening, please and terrify themselves, and the
children who compose their audience, with strange
relations of these things, till they are even afraid of
removing their eyes from one another, for fear of
seeing a <i>pale spectre</i> entering the room. Frightful
ideas raised in the minds of children take so
strong a possession of the faculties, that they
often remain for ever fixed, and all the arguments
of reason are unable to remove them. Hence it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
is, that so many grown-up people still keep the
ridiculous fears of their infancy. I know a lady,
of very good sense in other things, who, if she is
left by herself after ten o'clock at night, will
faint away at the terror of thinking some horrid
spectre, with eyes sunk, meagre countenance, and
threatening aspect, is standing at her elbow. And
an Officer in the Guards, of my acquaintance,
who has often, abroad, shewn no concern in
marching up to the mouth of a cannon, has not
courage enough to be in the dark without company.
As I take the fear of ghosts, like all other
prejudices, to be imbibed in our infancy, I would
recommend this advice to parents&mdash;to use the
utmost care, that the minds of their children are
not vitiated by their servants' tales of ghosts, hobgoblins,
and bugbears; which, though told to
please, or frighten them into good, seldom fail of
producing the very worst effects.</p>

<p>There are some who are ghost-mad, and terrify
themselves, because the Scripture has mentioned
the appearance of ghosts. I shall not dispute,
but, by the power of God, an incorporeal being
may be visible to human eyes; but then, an all-wise
Power would not have recourse to a preternatural
effect but on some important occasion.
Therefore, my intention is only to laugh a ridiculous
fear out of the world, by shewing on what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
absurd and improbable foundations the common
nature of ghosts and apparitions are built.</p>

<p>In the country, there are generally allowed to
be two sorts of ghosts;&mdash;the vulgar ghost, and the
ghost of dignity. The latter is always the spirit
of some Lord of the Manor, or Justice of the
Peace, who, still desirous to see how affairs go
on in his parish, rattles through it in a coach and
six, much about midnight. This ghost is, in
every respect, the very same man that the person
whom he represents was in his life-time. Nay,
the spirit, though incorporeal, has on its body all
the marks which the Squire had on his; the scar
on the cheek, the dimple on the chin, and twenty
other demonstrative signs, which are visible to
any old woman in the parish, that can <i>see clearly
in a dark night</i>!</p>

<p>The ghost keeps up to the character of a good
old grave gentleman, who is heartily sorry to think
his son will not live upon his estate, but rambles
up to London, and runs it out, perhaps, in
extravagance. He therefore does nothing inconsistent
with the gravity of his character; but, still
retaining the generous heart of a true Briton,
keeps up his equipage, and loves good living and
hospitality; for, a little time after the coach and
six has, with a solemn rumble, passed through
the village into his own court-yard, there is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
great noise heard in the house, of servants running
up and down stairs, the jacks going, and a
great clattering of plates and dishes. Thus he
spends an hour or two every midnight, in living
well, after he has been some years dead; but is
complaisant enough to leave every thing, at his
departure, in the same position that he found
them.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a little town in all England,
but has an old female spirit appertaining to it,
who, in her high-crown hat, nicely clean linen, and
red petticoat, has been viewed by half the parish.
This article of dress is of mighty concern among
some ghosts; wherefore a skilful and learned apparition
writer, in the Preface of Drelincourt on
Death, makes a very pious ghost talk to a lady
upon the important subject of scouring a mantua.
Before I leave my ghost of dignity, I must take
notice of some who delight to seem as formidable
as possible, and who are not content with
appearing without heads themselves, but their
coachmen and horses must be without their's too,
and the coach itself frequently all on fire. These
spirits, I know not for what reason, are universally
allowed to have been people of first quality,
and courtiers.</p>

<p>As for the vulgar ghost, it seldom appears in
its own bodily likeness, unless it be with a throat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
cut from ear to ear, or a winding-sheet; but
humbly contents itself with the body of a white
horse, that gallops over the meadows without
legs, and grazes without a head. On other occasions,
it takes the appearance of a black shock
dog, which, with great goggle, glaring eyes, stares
you full in the face, but never hurts you more
than unmannerly pushing you from the wall.
Sometimes a friendly ghost surprises you with
a hand as cold as clay; at other times, that same
ghostly hand gives three solemn raps, with several
particularities, according to the different dispositions
of the ghost.</p>

<p>The chief reason which calls them back again
to visit the world by night, is their fondness for
some old broad pieces, or a pot of money, they
buried in their life-time; and they cannot rest to
have it lie useless, therefore the gold raises them
before the resurrection.</p>

<p>Mr. Addison's charming Essay, in the <cite>Spectator</cite>,
is so applicable and prefatory to a work of this
nature, that we cannot resist inserting that inimitable
production in his own words.</p>

<p>"Going to dine," says he, "with an old acquaintance,
I had the misfortune to find his whole
family very much dejected. Upon asking him the
occasion of it, he told me that his wife had dreamt
a strange dream the night before, which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
were afraid portended some misfortune to themselves
or to their children. At her coming into
the room, I observed a settled melancholy in her
countenance, which I should have been troubled
for, had I not heard from whence it proceeded.
We were no sooner sat down, but, after having
looked upon me a little while, 'My dear,' says
she, turning to her husband, 'you may now see
the stranger that was in the candle last night.'
Soon after this, as they began to talk of family
affairs, a little boy at the lower end of the table
told her, that he was to go into join-hand on
Thursday. 'Thursday!' says she; 'no, child;
if it please God, you shall not begin upon Childermas-day;
tell your writing-master, that Friday
will be soon enough.' I was reflecting with myself
on the oddness of her fancy, and wondering
that any body would establish it as a rule to
lose a day in every week. In the midst of these
my musings, she desired me to reach her a
little salt upon the point of my knife, which I
did in such a trepidation and hurry of obedience,
that I let it drop by the way; at which she immediately
startled, and said it fell towards her.
Upon this I looked very blank; and, observing
the concern of the whole table, began to consider
myself, with some confusion, as a person
that had brought a disaster upon the family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The lady, however, recovering herself after a
little space, said to her husband, with a sigh, 'My
dear, misfortunes never come single.' My friend,
I found, acted but an under part at his table; and,
being a man of more good-nature than understanding,
thinks himself obliged to fall in with
all the passions and humours of his yoke-fellow.
'Do not you remember, child,' said she, 'that the
pigeon-house fell the very afternoon that our careless
wench spilt the salt upon the table?' 'Yes,'
says he, 'my dear; and the next post brought us
an account of the battle of Almanza.' The reader
may guess at the figure I made, after having done
all this mischief. I dispatched my dinner as soon
as I could, with my usual taciturnity; when, to my
utter confusion, the lady seeing me quitting my
knife and fork, and laying them across one another
upon the plate, desired me that I would
humour her so far as to take them out of that
figure, and place them side by side. What the
absurdity was which I had committed, I did not
know, but I suppose there was some traditionary
superstition in it; and therefore, in obedience to
the lady of the house, I disposed of my knife and
fork in two parallel lines, which is the figure I
shall always lay them in for the future, though I
do not know any reason for it.</p>

<p>"It is not difficult for a man to see that a person
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>has conceived an aversion to him. For my
own part, I quickly found, by the lady's looks,
that she regarded me as a very odd kind of fellow,
with an unfortunate aspect. For which reason I
took my leave immediately after dinner, and withdrew
to my own lodgings. Upon my return
home, I fell into a profound contemplation on the
evils that attend these superstitious follies of mankind;
how they subject us to imaginary afflictions
and additional sorrows, that do not properly come
within our lot. As if the natural calamities of
life were not sufficient for it, we turn the most indifferent
circumstances into misfortunes, and suffer
as much from trifling accidents as from real evils.
I have known the shooting of a star spoil a night's
rest; and have seen a man in love grow pale, and
lose his appetite, upon the plucking of a merry-thought.
A screech-owl at midnight has alarmed
a family more than a band of robbers; nay, the
voice of a cricket hath struck more terror than
the roaring of a lion. There is nothing so inconsiderable,
which may not appear dreadful to an
imagination that is filled with omens and prognostics.
A rusty nail, or a crooked pin, shoot up
into prodigies.</p>

<p>"I remember, I was once in a mixed assembly,
that was full of noise and mirth, when on a sudden
an old woman unluckily observed there were thirteen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>of us in company. This remark struck a
panic terror into several who were present, insomuch
that one or two of the ladies were going to
leave the room: but a friend of mine, taking notice
that one of our female companions was big
with child, affirmed there were fourteen in the
room; and that, instead of portending one of the
company should die, it plainly foretold one of
them should be born. Had not my friend found
out this expedient to break the omen, I question
not but half the women in the company would
have fallen sick that very night.</p>

<p>"An old maid, that is troubled with the vapours,
produces infinite disturbances of this kind among
her friends and neighbours. I once knew a
maiden aunt, of a great family, who is one of
these antiquated sybils, that forebodes and prophesies
from one end of the year to the other.
She is always seeing apparitions, and hearing
death-watches; and was the other day almost
frightened out of her wits by the great house-dog,
that howled in the stable at a time when she lay
ill of the tooth-ach. Such an extravagant cast of
mind engages multitudes of people not only in
impertinent terrors, but in supernumerary duties
of life; and arises from that fear and ignorance
which are natural to the soul of man. The horror
with which we entertain the thoughts of death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
or indeed of any future evil, and the uncertainty
of its approach, fill a melancholy mind with innumerable
apprehensions and suspicions, and consequently
dispose it to the observation of such
groundless prodigies and predictions. For, as it
is the chief concern of wise men to retrench the
evils of life by the reasonings of philosophy, it is
the employment of fools to multiply them by the
sentiments of superstition.</p>

<p>"For my own part, I should be very much
troubled, were I endowed with this divining quality,
though it should inform me truly of every
thing that can befal me. I would not anticipate
the relish of any happiness, nor feel the weight of
any misery, before it actually arrives.</p>

<p>"I know but one way of fortifying my soul
against these gloomy presages and terrors of mind;
and that is, by securing to myself the friendship
and protection of that Being who disposes of
events, and governs futurity. He sees at one
view the whole thread of my existence; not only
that part of it which I have already passed
through, but that which runs forward into all the
depths of eternity. When I lay me down to
sleep, I recommend myself to his care; when I
awake, I give myself up to his direction. Amidst
all the evils that threaten me, I will look up to
him for help and question not but he will either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
avert them, or turn them to my advantage.
Though I know neither the time nor the manner
of the death I am to die, I am not at all solicitous
about it; because I am sure that he knows them
both, and that he will not fail to comfort and support
me under them."</p>

<p>In another paper, the same gentleman thus expresses
himself on the same subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I remember, last winter, there were several
young girls of the neighbourhood sitting about the
fire with my landlady's daughters, and telling stories
of spirits and apparitions. Upon my opening
the door, the young women broke off their discourse;
but my landlady's daughters telling them
it was nobody but the gentleman (for that is the
name which I go by in the neighbourhood as well
as in the family), they went on without minding me.
I seated myself by the candle that stood on a
table at one end of the room; and, pretending to
read a book that I took out of my pocket, heard
several dreadful stories of ghosts as pale as ashes,
that stood at the feet of a bed, or walked over
a church-yard by moonlight; and of others that
had been conjured into the Red Sea, for disturbing
people's rest, and drawing their curtains at
midnight; with many other old women's fables of
the like nature. As one spirit raised another, I
observed that at the end of every story the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
company closed their ranks, and crowded about
the fire. I took notice in particular of a little boy,
who was so attentive to every story, that I am mistaken
if he ventures to go to bed by himself this
twelvemonth. Indeed, they talked so long, that
the imaginations of the whole assembly were manifestly
crazed, and, I am sure, will be the worse
for it as long as they live. I heard one of the
girls, that had looked upon me over her shoulder,
asking the company how long I had been in the
room, and whether I did not look paler than I
used to do. This put me under some apprehensions
that I should be forced to explain myself, if
I did not retire; for which reason I took the candle
in my hand, and went up into my chamber,
not without wondering at this unaccountable weakness
in reasonable creatures, that they should love
to astonish and terrify one another. Were I a
father, I should take particular care to preserve
my children from those little horrors of imagination,
which they are apt to contract when they
are young, and are not able to shake off when they
are in years. I have known a soldier, that has
entered a breach, affrighted at his own shadow,
and look pale upon a little scratching at his door,
who the day before had marched up against a
battery of cannon. There are instances of persons
who have been terrified, even to distraction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
at the figure of a tree, or the shaking of a bulrush.
The truth of it is, I look upon a sound
imagination as the greatest blessing of life, next
to a clear judgment and a good conscience. In
the mean time, since there are very few whose
minds are not more or less subject to these dreadful
thoughts and apprehensions, we ought to arm
ourselves against them by the dictates of reason
and religion, to <i>pull the old woman out of our
hearts</i> (as Persius expresses it), and extinguish
those impertinent notions which we imbibed at a
time that we were not able to judge of their absurdity.
Or, if we believe, as many wise and
good men have done, that there are such phantoms
and apparitions as those I have been speaking
of, let us endeavour to establish to ourselves
an interest in Him who holds the reins of the
whole creation in his hand, and moderates them
after such a manner, that it is impossible for one
being to break loose upon another without his
knowledge and permission.</p>

<p>"For my own part, I am apt to join in opinion
with those who believe that all the regions of
nature swarm with spirits; and that we have multitudes
of spectators on all our actions, when we
think ourselves most alone. But, instead of terrifying
myself with such a notion, I am wonderfully
pleased to think that I am always engaged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with such an innumerable society, in searching
out the wonders of the creation, and joining in
the same concert of praise and adoration.</p>

<p>"Milton has finely described this mixed communion
of men and spirits in Paradise; and had,
doubtless, his eye upon a verse in old Hesiod,
which is almost, word for word, the same with his
third line in the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">'&mdash;&mdash;Nor think, though men were none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Heav'n would want spectators, God want praise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these with ceaseless praise his works behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both day and night. How often from the steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Celestial voices to the midnight air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sole, or responsive each to other's note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing their great Creator? Oft in bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In full harmonic number join'd, their songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to heav'n.'&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another celebrated writer says&mdash;"Some are
over credulous in these stories, others sceptical
and distrustful, and a third sort perfectly infidel.</p>

<p>"Mr. Locke assures us, we have as clear an idea
of spirit as of body. But, if it be asked, how a
spirit, that never was embodied, can form to itself
a body, and come up into a world where it has
no right of residence, and have all its organs perfected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>at once; or how a spirit, once embodied,
but now in a separate state, can take up its carcase
out of the grave, sufficiently repaired, and make
many resurrections before the last; or how the
dead can counterfeit their own bodies, and make
to themselves an image of themselves; by what
ways and means, since miracles ceased, this transformation
can be effected; by whose leave and
permission, or by what power and authority, or
with what wise design, and for what great ends and
purposes, all this is done, we cannot easily imagine;
and the divine and philosopher together will
find it very difficult to resolve such questions.</p>

<p>"Before the Christian æra, some messages from
the other world might be of use, if not necessary,
in some cases, and on some extraordinary occasions;
but since that time we want no new, nor
can we have any surer, informations.</p>

<p>"Conscience, indeed, is a frightful apparition
itself; and I make no question but it oftentimes
haunts an oppressing criminal into restitution, and
is a ghost to him sleeping or waking: nor is it
the least testimony of an invisible world, that there
is such a drummer as that in the soul, that can
beat an alarm when he pleases, and so loud, as
no other noise can drown it, no music quiet it, no
power silence it, no mirth allay it, and no bribe
corrupt it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>Inexhaustible are the opinions on this subject:
therefore we shall conclude this Essay, and proceed
to the more illustrative part of our work,
without any further quotations; for various are
the methods proposed by the learned for the laying
of ghosts and apparitions. Artificial ones are
easily quieted, if we only take them for real and
substantial beings, and proceed accordingly.
Thus, when a Friar, personating an apparition,
haunted the apartment of the late Emperor Joseph,
King Augustus, then at the Imperial court, flung
him out of the window, and laid him upon the
pavement so effectually, that he never rose or
appeared again in this world.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
DOMINICAN FRIAR.</h2>

<p class="chapsub"><i>An Extraordinary Event that happened lately
at Aix-la-Chapelle.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the following story, which is averred to be
authentic, and to have happened very lately, may
serve to shew, that the stories of this kind, with
which the public are, from time to time, every
now and then alarmed, are nothing more than
artful impostures, it is presumed, it will be useful
as well as entertaining to our readers to give it
a place.</p>

<p>A person who kept a lodging-house near the
springs at Aix-la-Chapelle, having lost his wife,
committed the management of his family to his
daughter, a sprightly, well-made, handsome girl,
about twenty.</p>

<p>There were, at that time, in the house, two
ladies and their waiting-woman, two Dutch officers,
and a Dominican Friar.</p>

<p>It happened, that, as the young woman of the
house was asleep one night in her bed, she was
awakened by something that attempted to draw
the clothes off the bed. She was at first frightened;
but thinking, upon recollection, that it might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the house-dog, she called him by his name. The
clothes, however, were still pulled from her; and
she still imagining it was by the dog, took up a
brush that lay in her reach, and attempted to strike
him. At that moment she saw a flash of sudden
light, that filled the whole room; upon which she
shrieked out; all was again dark and silent, and
the clothes were no longer drawn from her.</p>

<p>In the morning, when she related this story,
every one treated it as a dream; and the girl herself
at last took it for granted, that it was no
more than an illusion.</p>

<p>The night following, she was again awakened
by something that jogged her, and she thought
she felt a hand in the bed; upon endeavouring to
repress it, another flash of lightning threw her
into a fit of terror: she shut her eyes, and crossed
herself. When she ventured to open her eyes
again, the light was vanished; but, in a short time,
she felt what she supposed to be a hand again in
the bed: she again endeavoured to repress it,
and, looking towards the foot of the bed, saw a
large luminous cross, on which was written distinctly,
as with light, the words, "<i>Be Silent!</i>"
She was now so terrified, that she had not power
to break the injunction, but shrunk down into
the bed, and covered herself over with the
clothes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>In this situation she continued a considerable
time; but, being again molested, she ventured
once more to peep out, when, to her unspeakable
astonishment, she saw a phantasm stand by the
side of her bed, almost as high as the ceiling: a
kind of glory encircled its head, and the whole
was in the form of a crucifix, except that it seemed
to have several hands, one of which again approached
the bed.</p>

<p>Supposing the phenomenon to be some celestial
vision, she exerted all her fortitude, and, leaping
out of bed, threw herself upon her knees before
it; but she instantly found herself assaulted in a
manner which convinced her she was mistaken:
she had not strength to disengage herself from
something that embraced her, and therefore screamed
out as loud as she could, to alarm the house,
and bring somebody to her assistance.</p>

<p>Her shrieks awakened the ladies who lay in an
adjacent chamber, and they sent their woman to
see what was the matter. The woman, upon opening
the room, saw a luminous phantasm, which
greatly terrified her, and heard, in a deep threatening
tone, the words&mdash;"<i>At thy peril be gone!</i>"</p>

<p>The woman instantly screamed out, and withdrew:
the ladies rose in the utmost consternation
and terror, but nobody came to their assistance:
the old man, the father of the girl, was asleep in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
remote part of the house; the Friar also rested in
a room at the end of a long gallery in another
story; and the two Dutch officers were absent on
a visit, at a neighbouring village.</p>

<p>No other violence, however, was offered to the
girl that night. As soon as the morning dawned,
she got up, ran down to her father, and told all
that had happened: the two ladies were not long
absent; they did not say much, but quitted the
house. The Friar asked the girl several questions,
and declared that he had heard other instances
of the like nature, but said, the girl would
do well to obey the commands of the vision, and
that no harm would come of it. He said, he
would remain to see the issue; and, in the mean
time, ordered proper prayers and masses to be
said at a neighbouring convent of his order, to
which he most devoutly joined his own.</p>

<p>The girl was comforted with this spiritual assistance;
but, notwithstanding, took one of the
maids to be her bedfellow the next night. In the
dead of the night, the flaming cross was again
visible, but no attempt was made on either of the
women. They were, however, greatly terrified;
and the servant said, she would rather leave her
place, than lie in the room again.</p>

<p>The Friar, the next morning, took the merit of
the spirit's peaceable behaviour to himself. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
prayers and masses were renewed, and application
was made to the convents at Liege for auxiliary
assistance. The good Friar, in the mean time,
was by no means idle at home: he performed his
devotions with great ardour, and towards evening
bestowed a plentiful libation of holy water on the
chamber and the bed.</p>

<p>The girl not being able to persuade the servant
to sleep with her again in the haunted room, and
being encouraged by the Friar to abide the issue,
having also great confidence herself in the prayers,
masses, and sprinklings, that had been used on the
occasion, she ventured once more to sleep in the
same room by herself.</p>

<p>In the night, after hearing some slight noises,
she saw the room all in a blaze, and a great number
of luminous crosses, with scraps of writing
here and there very legible, among which the precept
<i>to be silent</i> was most conspicuous.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room she saw something
of a human appearance, which seemed covered
only with a linen garment, like a shirt: it appeared
to diffuse a radiance round it; and, at
length, by a slow and silent pace, approached
the bed.</p>

<p>When it came up to the bed-side, it drew the
curtain more open, and, lifting up the bed-clothes,
was about to come in. The girl, now more terrified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>than ever, screamed out with all her power.
As every body in the house was upon the watch,
she was heard by them all; but the father only
had courage to go to her assistance, and his
bravery was probably owing to a considerable
quantity of reliques, which he had procured
from the convent, and which he brought in his
hand.</p>

<p>When he came, however, nothing was to be
seen but some of the little crosses and inscriptions,
several of which were now luminous only in
part.</p>

<p>Being himself greatly terrified at these appearances,
he ran to the Friar's apartment, and with
some difficulty prevailed upon him to go with him
to the haunted room. The Friar at first excused
himself upon account of the young woman's being
there in bed. As soon as he entered, and saw the
crosses, he prostrated himself on the ground, and
uttered many prayers and incantations, to which
the honest landlord most heartily said <i>Amen</i>.</p>

<p>The poor girl, in the mean time, lay in a kind
of trance; and her father, when the prayers were
over, ran down stairs for some wine, a cordial
being necessary to recover her: the Friar, at
the same time, ordered him to light and bring
with him a consecrated taper; for hitherto they
had no light but that of the vision, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
still strong enough to discover every thing in the
room.</p>

<p>In a short time the old man entered with a
taper in his hand; and in a moment all the luminous
appearances vanished. The girl, soon after,
recovered, and gave a very sensible account of all
that had happened; and the landlord and the
Friar spent the rest of the night together.</p>

<p>The Friar, however, to shew the power of the
dæmon, and the holy virtue of the taper, removed
it several times from the chamber, before the day
broke, and the crosses and inscriptions were again
visible, and remained so till the taper was brought
back, and then vanished as at first.</p>

<p>When the sun arose, the Friar took his leave to
go to matins, and did not return till noon. In
the mean time the two Dutch officers came home,
and soon learnt what had happened, though the
landlord took all the pains he could to conceal
it. The reports they heard were confirmed by
the pale and terrified appearance of the girl; their
curiosity was greatly excited, and they asked her
innumerable questions. Her answers, instead of
extinguishing, increased it. They assured the
landlord, they would not leave his house, but, on
the contrary, would afford him all the assistance
in their power.</p>

<p>As they were young gentlemen of a military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
profession, and Protestants, they were at once
bold and incredulous. They pretended, however,
to adopt the opinion of the landlord, that the
appearances were supernatural; but it happened
that, upon going into the room, they found the
remainder of the taper, on the virtues of which the
landlord had so largely expatiated, and immediately
perceived that it was only a common candle
of a large size, which he had brought by mistake
in his fright.</p>

<p>This discovery convinced them that there was
a fraud, and that appearances that vanished at the
approach of unconsecrated light must be produced
by mere human artifice.</p>

<p>They therefore consulted together, and at length
agreed, that the masses should be continued; that
the landlord should not say one word of the candle,
or the suspicions it had produced; that his
daughter, the next night, should sleep in the
apartment which had been quitted by the ladies;
and that one of the officers should lie in the girl's
bed, while the other, with the landlord, should
wait in the kitchen, to see the issue.</p>

<p>This plan was accordingly, with great secrecy,
carried into execution.</p>

<p>For two hours after the officer had been in bed,
all was silent and quiet, and he began to suspect
that the girl had either been fanciful, or that their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
secret had transpired: when, all on a sudden, he
heard the latch of the door gently raised; and,
perceiving something approach the bed and attempt
to take up the clothes, he resisted with
sufficient strength to frustrate the attempt, and
immediately the room appeared to be all in a
flame; he saw many crosses, and inscriptions enjoining
silence and a passive acquiescence in
whatever should happen; he saw also, in the
middle of the room, something of a human appearance,
very tall, and very luminous. The
officer was at first struck with terror, and the
vision made a second approach to the bed-side;
but the gentleman, recovering his fortitude with
the first moment of reflection, dexterously threw a
slip knot, which he had fastened to one of the bed-posts,
over the phantom's neck: he instantly drew
it close, which brought him to the ground, and
then threw himself upon him. The fall and the
struggle made so much noise, that the other officer
and the landlord ran up with lights and weapons;
and the goblin was found to be no other
than the good Friar, who, having conceived something
more than a spiritual affection for his landlord's
pretty daughter, had played this infernal
farce, to gratify his passion.</p>

<p>Being now secured and detected, beyond hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of subterfuge or escape, he made a full confession
of his guilt, and begged earnestly for mercy.</p>

<p>It appeared that this fellow, who was near six
feet high, had made himself appear still taller,
by putting upon his head a kind of <i>tiara</i> of embossed
paper, and had also thrust a stick through
the sleeves of his habit, which formed the appearance
of a cross, and still left his hands at liberty;
and that he had rendered himself and his apparatus
visible in the dark by <i>phosphorus</i>.</p>

<p>The landlord contented himself with giving his
reverence a hearty drubbing, and then turning
him out of doors, with a strict injunction to quit
the territory of Liege for ever, upon pain of being
much more severely treated.</p>

<p>When it is considered, that it is but a few years
ago, that a poor woman, within twenty miles of
London, lost her life upon supposition that she was
a witch; and that it is not many years since the
Cock-lane ghost found advocates, even in the heart
of London itself, among those who, before, were
never accounted fools; it cannot but be useful
to put down on record every imposition of this
kind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
SUPERSTITIOUS COUPLE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the letters from a gentleman on his travels in
Italy to his friend in England, is the following curious
account of an experiment tried with the
Bolognian stone, of which phosphorus is made.</p>

<p>There was an English maid-servant in the house
where we lodged, (observes this gentleman), and
her bed-chamber was immediately over the one
occupied by myself and friend. My companion
having found his way into it, or, at least, supposing
he had done so, wrote with some paste made
merely with flour and water, the terrible words&mdash;"<span class="ucsmcap">REMEMBER
DEATH!</span>" in great capitals, on the
inside of the bed-curtains. Over the wet letters
he strewed some of the crust prepared from this
stone, which he had powdered for that purpose in
a mortar; and, when he had so done, called me
up, to see the words in letters of fire. We sat up
for the discovery; but something very different
from what we had expected, happened. The
Italians are bigots, and consequently superstitious.
It happened that the room, into which my friend
had found his way, was not, as he imagined, that
of the maid-servant, but of a couple of devout
people, who accidentally slept in the house. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
heard them undress; and followed our scheme, by
getting on the upper stairs near the door of the
room: we heard two voices, and we saw the candle
on a table near the bed-side. The lady was
first in bed; and the good man no sooner followed,
than the candle was put out. On the instant of
its extinction, appeared the terrible words. The
lady screamed her prayers; the husband trembled
over his Ave-Marias. The letters were absolutely
fire, and the bed was not injured. The language
was unintelligible to those who saw the words;
and, perhaps, it was in that respect more terrifying,
than if the admonition had been understood.
The <i>Mene Tekel</i> of the prophet came into both
their minds at once. They jumped out of bed,
and alarmed the whole house. We were first in
the room. My friend took occasion, in their confusion,
to scrape off the whole matter very cleanly
with his pocket knife. The company brought
candles&mdash;there was nothing to be seen. Both
husband and wife pointed to the place where the
writing had appeared; but nothing but some
smeared dirt was visible there. My friend kept
his counsel, and the miracle was blazed all over
Bologna the next day; and we left a legion of wondering
priests in the house at our departure!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
HAUNTED BED-ROOM.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> gentleman, going down from London
to the west of England, to the house of a very
worthy gentleman, to whom he had the honour to
be related; it happened, that the gentleman's house
was at that time full, by season of a kinswoman's
wedding, that had lately been kept there. He
therefore told the young gentleman, that he was
very glad to see him, and that he was very welcome
to him: "But," said he, "I know not how
I shall do for a lodging for you; for my cousin's
marriage has not left a room free, save one, and
that is haunted; but if you will lie there, you
shall have a very good bed, and all other accommodations."
"Sir," replied the young gentleman,
"you will very much oblige me by letting me lie
there; for I have often coveted to be in a place
that was haunted." The gentleman, very glad
that his kinsman was so well pleased with his accommodations,
ordered the chamber to be got
ready, and a good fire to be made in it, it being
winter-time. When bed-time came, the young
gentleman was conducted up into his chamber,
which, besides a good fire, was furnished with all
suitable accommodations; and, having recommended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>himself to the Divine protection, went
to bed. Lying some time awake, and finding no
disturbance, he fell asleep; out of which, however,
he was awaked about three o'clock in the morning,
by the opening of the chamber-door, and the
entrance of somebody in the appearance of a
young woman, having a night-dress on her head,
and only her shift on: but he had no perfect view
of her, for his candle was burnt out; and though
there was a fire in the room, yet it gave not light
enough to see her distinctly. But this unknown
visitant going to the chimney, took the poker, and
stirred up the fire; by the flaming light whereof,
he could discern the appearance of a young gentlewoman
more distinctly; but whether it was flesh
and blood, or an airy phantom, he knew not. This
appearance having stood some time before the fire,
as if to warm itself, at last walked two or three
times about the room, and then came to the bed-side;
where having stood a little while, she took
up the bed-clothes, and went into bed, pulling the
bed-clothes upon her again, and lying very quietly.
The young gentleman was a little startled at this
unknown bed-fellow; and, upon her approach, lay
on the further side of the bed, not knowing whether
he had best rise or not. At last, lying very
still, he perceived his bed-fellow to breathe; by
which guessing her to be flesh and blood, he drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
nearer to her, and taking her by the hand, found
it warm, and that it was no airy phantom, but
substantial flesh and blood; and finding she had
a ring on her finger, he took it off unperceived.
The gentlewoman being all this while asleep, he
let her lie without disturbing her, and patiently
waited the result of this singular situation. He
had not long remained in suspense, when his fair
companion hastily flung off the bed-clothes again,
and getting up, walked three or four times about
the room; as she had done before; and then,
standing awhile before the door, opened it, went
out, and shut it after her. The young gentleman,
perceiving by this in what manner the room was
haunted, rose up, and locked the door on the
inside; and then lay down again, and slept till
morning; at which time the master of the house
came to him, to know how he did, and whether
he had seen any thing, or not? He told him, that
an apparition had appeared to him, but begged
the favour of him that he would not urge him to
say any thing further, till the whole family were
all together. The gentleman complied with his
request, telling his young friend, that, having
found him well, he was perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>The desire the whole family had to know the
issue of this affair, made them dress with more
expedition than usual, so that there was a general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
assembly of the gentlemen and ladies before eleven
o'clock, not one of them being willing to appear
in dishabille. When they were all got together
in the great hall, the young gentleman told them,
he had one favour to desire of the ladies before he
would say any thing, and that was, to know whether
either of them had lost a ring? The young
gentlewoman, from whose finger it was taken,
having missed it all the morning, and not knowing
how she lost it, was glad to hear of it again, and
readily owned she wanted a ring. The young
gentleman asked her if that was it, giving it into
her hand, which she acknowledging to be her's,
and thanking him, he turned to his kinsman, the
master of the house&mdash;"Now Sir," said he, "I
can assure you," (taking the gentlewoman by the
hand) "this is the lovely spirit by which your
chamber is haunted."&mdash;And thereupon repeated
what is related.</p>

<p>I want words to express the confusion the young
gentlewoman seemed to be in at this relation, who
declared herself perfectly ignorant of all that he
said; but believed it might be so, because of the
ring, which she perfectly well remembered she had
on when she went to bed, and knew not how she
had lost it.</p>

<p>This relation gave the whole company a great
deal of diversion; for, after all, the father declared,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>that since his daughter had already gone
to bed to his kinsman, it should be his fault if he
did not go to bed to his daughter, he being willing
to bestow her upon him, and give her a good portion.
This generous offer was so advantageous to
the young gentleman, that he could by no means
refuse it; and his late bed-fellow, hearing what
her father had said, was easily prevailed upon to
accept him for her husband.</p>

<h2><span class="sm">REMARKABLE INSTANCE</span><br />
<span class="xsm">OF THE</span><br />
POWER OF IMAGINATION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been remarked, that when the royal vault
is opened for the interment of any of the royal
family, Westminster Abbey is a place of great
resort: some flock thither out of curiosity, others
to indulge their solemn meditations.</p>

<p>By the former of these motives it was, when
the royal vault was opened for the interment of
her illustrious Majesty Queen Caroline, that five
or six gentlemen who had dined together at a
tavern were drawn to visit that famous repository
of the titled dead. As they descended down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
steep descent, one cried&mdash;"It's hellish dark;"
another stopped his nostrils, and exclaimed
against the nauseous vapour that ascended from
it; all had their different sayings. But, as it is
natural for such spectacles to excite some moral
reflections, even with the most gay and giddy,
they all returned with countenances more serious
than those they had entered with.</p>

<p>Having agreed to pass the evening together,
they all went back to the place where they dined;
and the conversation turned on a future state,
apparitions, and some such topics. One among
them was an infidel in those matters, especially
as to spirits becoming visible, and took upon him
to rally the others, who seemed rather inclinable
to the contrary way of thinking. As it is easier
to deny than to prove, especially where those
that maintain the negative will not admit any
testimonies which can be brought against their
own opinion, he singly held out against all they
had to alledge. To end the contest, they proposed
to him a wager of twenty guineas, that, as great a
hero as he pretended, or really imagined himself,
he had not courage enough to go alone at midnight
into the vault they had seen that day. This
he readily accepted, and was very merry with the
thoughts of getting so much money with such ease.
The money on both sides was deposited in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
hands of the master of the house; and one of the
vergers was sent for, whom they engaged, for a
piece of gold, to attend the adventurer to the gate
of the cathedral, then shut him in, and wait his
return.</p>

<p>Every thing being thus settled, the clock no
sooner struck twelve, than they all set out together;
they who laid the wager being resolved not
to be imposed on by his tampering with the verger.
As they passed along, a scruple arose,
which was, that though they saw him enter the
church, how they should be convinced he went
as far as the vault; but he instantly removed their
doubts, by pulling out a pen-knife he had in his
pocket, and saying, "This will I stick into the
earth, and leave it there; and if you do not find
it in the inside of the vault, I will own the wager
lost." These words left them nothing to suspect;
and they agreed to wait at the door his coming
out, believing he had no less stock of resolution
than he had pretended: it is possible, the opinion
they had of him was no more than justice.</p>

<p>But, whatever stock of courage he had, on his
entrance into that antique and reverend pile, he
no sooner found himself shut alone in it, than, as
he afterwards confessed, he found a kind of shuddering
all over him, which, he was sensible, proceeded
from something more than the coldness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the night. Every step he took was echoed by
the hollow ground; and, though it was not altogether
dark, the verger having left a lamp burning
just before the door that led to the chapel (otherwise
it would have been impossible for him to have
found the place), yet did the glimmering it gave,
rather add to, than diminish, the solemn horror of
every thing around.</p>

<p>He passed on, however; but protested, had not
the shame of being laughed at, prevented him, he
would have forfeited more than twice the sum he
had staked to have been safe out again. At length
he reached the entrance of the vault: his inward
terror increased; yet, determined not to be overpowered
by fear, he descended; and being come
to the last stair, stooped forwards, and struck the
pen-knife with his whole force into the earth. But,
as he was rising in order to quit so dreadful a place,
he felt something pluck him forward; the apprehension
he before was in, made an easy way for
surprise and terror to seize on all his faculties: he
lost in one instant every thing that could support
him, and fell into a swoon, with his head in the
vault, and part of his body on the stairs.</p>

<p>Till after one o'clock his friends waited with
some degree of patience, though they thought he
paid the titled dead a much longer visit than a
living man could choose. But, finding he did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
come, they began to fear some accident: the verger,
they found, though accustomed to the place,
did not choose to go alone; they therefore went
with him, preceded by a torch, which a footman
belonging to one of the company had with him.
They all went into the Abbey, calling, as they
went, as loud as they could: no answer being
made, they moved on till they came to the vault;
where, looking down, they soon perceived what
posture he was in. They immediately used
every means they could devise for his recovery,
which they soon effected.</p>

<p>After they got him out of the Abbey to the fresh
air, he fetched two or three deep groans; and, in
the greatest agitation, cried, "Heaven help me!
Lord have mercy upon me!" These exclamations
very much surprised them; but, imagining he was
not yet come perfectly to his senses, they forbore
farther questions, till they had got him into the
tavern, where, having placed him in a chair, they
began to ask how he did, and how he came to
be so indisposed. He gave them a faithful detail,
and said, he should have come back with the same
sentiments he went with, had not an unseen hand
convinced him of the injustice of his unbelief.
While he was making his narrative, one of the
company saw the pen-knife sticking through the
fore-lappet of his coat. He immediately conjectured
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>the mistake; and, pulling out the pen-knife
before them all, cried out, "Here is the mystery
discovered: for, in the attitude of stooping to stick
the knife in the ground, it happened, as you see,
to go through the coat; and, on your attempting
to rise, the terror you was in magnified this little
obstruction into an imaginary impossibility of withdrawing
yourself, and had an effect on your senses
before reason had time to operate." This, which
was evidently the case, set every one, except the
gentleman who had suffered so much by it, into a
roar of laughter. But it was not easy to draw a
single smile from him: he ruminated on the affair,
while his companions rallied and ridiculed this
change in him: he well remembered the agitations
he had been in. "Well," replied he; when he
had sufficiently recovered, "there is certainly
something after death, or these strange impulses
could never be. What is there in a church more
than in any other building? what in darkness
more than light, which in themselves should have
power to raise such ideas as I have now experienced?
Yes," continued he, "I am convinced
that I have been too presumptuous: and, whether
spirits be or be not permitted to appear, that
they exist, I ever shall believe."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
WESTMINSTER SCHOLARS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> years since, some Westminster scholars
received great insult from a hackney-coachman,
who treated them with the greatest scurrility, because
they would not comply with an overcharge
in his fare. This behaviour the youths did not
forget, and were resolved to punish him without
danger of prosecution; upon which one of them
devised the following whimsical turn of revenge.</p>

<p>Four of these gentlemen, one dark evening, about
nine o'clock, (having previously learned where his
coach would be) called him from off the stand,
and desired the coachman to drive over Westminster
Bridge to Newington. They had not long
been seated, when one of them, with a sportive
tone of voice, said, "Come, boys, let us begin."</p>

<p>They then instantly dressed themselves in black
clothes, and every necessary befitting mourners at
a funeral, (which articles they brought with them
in small parcels.) And the night was particularly
favourable for carrying their scheme into execution:
for it was uncommonly dark, and <i>very still</i>.
'Twas such a night that Apollonius Rhodius thus
describes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<span class="i00">"Night on the earth pour'd darkness; on the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wakesome sailor to Orion's star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Helice turn'd heedful. Sunk to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The traveller forgot his toil; his charge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The centinel; her death-devoted babe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother's painless breast. The village dog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had ceas'd his troublous bay: each busy tumult<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was hush'd at this dread hour; and darkness slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lock'd in the arms of silence."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To terrify him the more, they wore linen hat-bands
and scarfs, instead of crape. And when
they had got into the loneliest part of St. George's
Fields (for at that time they were not built over as
at present), they called to him, and desired him to
stop, as they wanted to get out.</p>

<p>They marked the side the coachman came to
open the door of; and he that sat next the other
door, opened it at the same instant.</p>

<p>What the coachman felt on seeing the first
mourner move out with the greatest solemnity,
can be better conceived than expressed: but what
were his terrors when the second approached him,
a majestic spare figure about six feet perpendicular,
who passed him (as did the first) without
speaking a word.</p>

<p>As fast as one youth got out, he went round to
the other side of the coach, stepped in, and came
out a second time at the opposite door.</p>

<p>In this manner they continued, till the coachman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>if he had the power of counting, might have
told forty.</p>

<p>When they had thus passed out seemingly to the
number of twenty, the poor devil of a coachman,
frightened almost to death, fell upon his knees,
and begged for mercy's sake the King of Terrors
would not suffer any more of his apparitions to
appear; for, though he had a multitude of sins to
account for, he had a wife and a large family of
children, who depended upon his earnings for
support.</p>

<p>The tallest of these young gentlemen then asked
him, in a hoarse tone of voice, what was his heaviest
sin? He replied, committing his lodger, a
poor carver and gilder, to the Marshalsea, for rent
due to him, which the badness of the times, and
his business in particular, would not enable him to
pay. He said, he would not have confined him
so long, but in revenge for a severe beating he
gave him one day when they fell to loggerheads
and boxed. He further told them, the poor man
had been six months in captivity; and that he
understood from a friend of his, the other day,
that he made out but a miserable living by making
brewers' pegs, bungs for their barrels, and watchmakers'
skewers.</p>

<p>The young gentleman then told him, that if he
did not instantly sign his discharge, which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
would write, he might rest assured of no mitigation
of the dreadful punishment he would go through
in a few minutes; for those he had seen come out
of his coach were his harpies in disguise, and were
now in readiness to bear him to the infernal regions.</p>

<p>The trembling villain, without the least hesitation,
complied. One of the scholars fortunately
having a pen and ink, the King of Terrors wrote
the discharge in a fair leaf of his pocket-book, as
well as he could in the dark, and then made the
coachman sign it.</p>

<p>Having so done, the scholars told him he might
go for the present, and that he would find his
coach in less than an hour in Piccadilly or Oxford
Street.</p>

<p>One of the youths then mounted the box, while
the others got within, and away they drove to the
Marshalsea, but in the way they stopped till they
had taken off their disguise.</p>

<p>The youth who had the discharge, after making
a collection among the others, went into the prison,
and gave the poor fellow what set him at liberty
the next morning.</p>

<p>The scholars then drove on to Oxford Street,
congratulating themselves on the success of their
adventure, and all happy to a degree of rapture
at being instrumental in obtaining the captive's
liberty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p><p>About a quarter of an hour after they quitted
the coach, they observed the coachman arrive;
who mounted the box, and drove home, muttering
the bitterest execrations, and damning his father
confessor for bilking him of half a guinea which
he gave him that morning for an absolution, that
was to have rubbed out the entire score of his
transgressions.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
IDEOT'S FUNERAL.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following extraordinary affair happened
about ten years since, at a village in the north of
England.</p>

<p>About midnight, the minister of the parish
was not a little alarmed at hearing the church bell
tolling. He immediately dispatched one of his
servants for the beadle, to inquire into the cause
of this wonderful event; who, when he came, appeared
to be under more dreadful apprehensions
than the clergyman himself. However, the result
of their deliberations was, that, in order to be
certainly informed of the truth and ground of the
matter, they should go forward to the church:
but, on their way, what served considerably to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
increase their fears, was their seeing a light within
the church. The great bell gave over tolling, and
was succeeded, in its turn, by the little, or handbell
(commonly used in that country at funerals),
which, in a short time, also became silent. On
their near approach to the church, they discovered,
by the help of the light within, the <i>mort-cloth</i>
moving up and down the area thereof. Though
this last part of the dreadful scene might have
been sufficient to intimidate persons possessed of
no ordinary degree of courage; yet such was the
bravery and resolution of the Reverend Doctor,
that he even ventured to accost the nocturnal disturber
of their repose: when, on lifting up the
<i>mort-cloth</i>, to his inexpressible surprise, he discovered
the terrible apparition to be only an unhappy
young man belonging to the parish, who
had for some time past been disordered in his
senses, and who had got into the church by some
secret means or other, and, as the good Doctor
readily conjectured, was amusing himself in this
manner, by the representation of a funeral: a case
not at all unlikely, as ideots in general are remarkably
fond of any thing relative to a funeral
procession.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
VENTRILOQUIST.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following anecdote is related by Adrianus
Turnibis, the greatest critic of the sixteenth century,
and who was admired and respected by all
the learned in Europe.</p>

<p>"There was a crafty fellow," says he, "called
Petrus Brabantius, who, as often as he pleased,
would speak from his stomach, with his mouth indeed
open, but his lips unmoved, of which I have
been repeatedly an eye and ear witness. In this
manner he put divers cheats on several persons:
amongst others, the following was well known.</p>

<p>"There was a merchant of Lyons, lately dead,
who had acquired a great estate by unjust dealings.
Brabantius happening to be at Lyons, and
hearing of this, comes one day to Cornutus, the
son and heir of this merchant, as he walked in a
portico behind the church-yard, and tells him
that he was sent to inform him of what was to be
done by him; and that it was more requisite to
think about the soul and reputation of his father,
than thus wander about the church-yard, lamenting
his death. In an instant, while they were thus
discoursing, a voice was heard, as if it was that
of the father, though, in reality, it proceeded from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his own stomach. Brabantius seemed terribly
affrighted. The voice informed the son the state
his father was in by reason of his injustice, what
tortures he endured in purgatory, both on his own,
and his son's account, whom he had left heir of
his ill-gotten goods: that no freedom was to be
expected by him, till just expiation was made
by giving alms to such as stood most in need, and
that these were the Christians who were taken by
the Turks: that he should put entire confidence in
the man who was by special providence now come
to him, and give him money, to be employed by
religious persons for the ransom of so many as
were captives at Constantinople. Cornutus, who
was a good sort of a man, yet loth to part with his
money, told Brabantius that he would advise upon
it; and desired he would meet him in the same
place the next day. In the mean time, he began
to suspect there might be some fraud in the place,
as it was shady, dark, and fit for echoes or other
delusions. The next day, therefore, he takes him
to an open plain, where there was neither bush
nor briar; but there, notwithstanding all his precaution,
he hears the same story, with this addition,
that he should forthwith deliver Brabantius
six thousand franks, and purchase three masses
daily to be said for him, or else the miserable soul
of his father could not be freed. Cornutus, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
thus bound by conscience, duty, and religion, yet
with reluctance delivered him the money, without
taking any receipt, or having any witness to
the payment of it. Having thus dismissed him,
and hearing no more of his father, he became
somewhat more pleasant than he had been since
his father's death. One day this change in him
was observed by some friends, who were at dinner
at his house; upon which he told them what
had befallen him: when his friends so derided
him, one and all, for his credulity, in being so simply
cheated of his money, that, for mere grief and
vexation, within a few days after, he died."</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
FEMALE FANATIC,<br />
<span class="xsm">AND</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>HEAVENLY VISITOR</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following curious affair happened a few
years since at Paris, and is well attested by a
gentleman of the greatest respectability.</p>

<p>A widow-lady, aged about sixty-two, who lodged
in a two-pair-of-stairs floor, in the <i>Rue de la Ferronnerie</i>,
with only a maid-servant, was accustomed
to spend several hours every day at her devotions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
before the altar dedicated to St. Paul, in a neighbouring
church. Some villains observing her extreme
bigotry, resolved (as she was known to be
very rich) to share her wealth. Therefore one of
them took the opportunity to conceal himself behind
the carved work of the altar; and when no
person but the old lady was in the church, in the
dusk of the evening, he contrived to throw a letter
just before her. She took it up, and not perceiving
any one near her, supposed it came by a miracle;
which she was the more confirmed in, when she
saw it was signed, <i>Paul the Apostle</i>, and purported,
"The satisfaction he received by her addressing
her prayers to him, at a time when so
many new-canonized saints engrossed the devotion
of the world, and robbed the primitive saints of
great part of their wonted adoration; and, to shew
his regard for his devotee, said, he would come
from Heaven, with the angel Gabriel, to sup with
her, at eight in the evening."</p>

<p>It is scarcely credible to think any one could be
deceived by so gross a fraud: but to what length
of credulity, will not superstition carry the weak
mind! The infatuated lady believed it all; and rose
from her knees in a transport, to prepare the entertainment
for the heavenly guests she expected.</p>

<p>When the supper was bespoke, and the sideboard
set out to the best advantage, she thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that her own plate (which was worth near four
hundred pounds sterling) did not make so elegant
a shew as she desired; therefore sent to her brother
(who was a Counsellor of the Parliament of
Paris) to borrow all his plate; charging her
maid not to tell the occasion, but only, that she
had company to supper, and should be obliged
to him if he would lend her his plate for that
evening. The Counsellor was surprised at this
message, as he knew the frugality of his sister's
way of life; and suspected that she was enamoured
with some fortune-hunter, who might marry her
for her fortune, and thereby deprive the family
of what he expected at his sister's death: therefore
he absolutely refused to send the plate, unless
the maid would tell him what guests she expected.
The girl, alarmed for her mistress's honour, replied,
that her pious lady had no thoughts of a husband;
but that, as St. Paul had sent her a letter from heaven,
saying, that he and the <i>Angel Gabriel</i> would
come to supper with her, her mistress wanted to
make the entertainment as elegant as possible.
The Counsellor, who knew the turn of his sister's
mind, immediately suspected some villains had
imposed on her; and sent the maid directly with
the plate, while he went to the Commissary of the
quarter, and gave him this information. The magistrate
accompanied him to a house adjoining, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
whence they saw, just before eight o'clock, a tall
man, dressed in long vestments, with a white beard,
and a young man in white, with large wings at his
shoulders, alight from a hackney-coach, and go up
to the widow's apartment. The Commissary immediately
ordered twelve of the foot <i>guet</i> (the
guards of Paris) to post themselves on the stairs,
while he himself knocked at the door, and desired
admittance. The old lady replied, that she had
company, and could speak to no one. But the
Commissary answered, that he must come in: for
that he was St. Peter, and had come to ask St.
Paul and the Angel, how they came out of heaven
without his knowledge. The divine visitors
were astonished at this, not expecting any more
Saints to join them: but the lady, overjoyed at
having so great an apostle with her, ran eagerly
to the door; when the Commissary, her brother,
and the <i>guet</i>, rushing in, presented their musquets,
and seized her guests, whom they immediately
carried to the Chatelot.</p>

<p>On searching the criminals, two cords, a razor,
and a pistol, were found in St. Paul's pocket; and a
gag in that of the feigned angel. Three days after,
their trial came on: when, in their defence, they
pleaded, that the one was a soldier of the French
foot-guards, and the other a barber's apprentice;
and that they had no other evil design, but to procure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>a good supper for themselves at the expence
of the widow's folly; that, it being carnival time,
they had borrowed the above dresses; that the
soldier had found the two cords, and put them
into his pocket; the razor was what he used to
shave himself with; and the pistol was to defend
himself from any insults so strange a habit might
expose him to, in going home. The barber's apprentice
said, his design also was only diversion;
and that, as his master was a tooth-drawer, the gag
was what they sometimes used in their business.
These excuses, frivolous as they were, were of
some avail to them; and, as they had not manifested
any evil design by an overt act, they were
acquitted.</p>

<p>But the Counsellor, who had foreseen what would
happen, through the insufficiency of evidence, had
provided another stroke for them. No sooner
were they discharged from the civil power, but the
Apparitor of the Archbishop of Paris seized them,
and conveyed them to the Ecclesiastical Prison;
and, in three days more, they were tried and convicted
of a scandalous profanation, by assuming
to themselves the names, characters, and appearances,
of an holy apostle and a blessed angel,
with an intent to deceive a pious and well-meaning
woman, and to the scandal of religion. On this
they were condemned to be publicly whipped,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
burnt on the shoulder by a hot iron, with the letters
G.A.L. and sent to the galleys for fourteen
years.</p>

<p>The sentence was executed on them the next
day, on a scaffold in the <i>Place de Greve</i>, amidst
an innumerable crowd of spectators: many of
whom condemned the superstition of the lady,
when perhaps they would have shewn the same on
a like occasion; since, it may be supposed, that if
many of <i>their</i> stories of apparitions, of saints, and
angels, had been judiciously examined, they would
have been found, like the above, to be either a gross
fraud, or the dreams of an over-heated, enthusiastic
imagination.</p>

<p>I shall make no reflections on the above fact;
but leave it to the impartial consideration of the
reader.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
FEMALE SPRITES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> September 1764, the following extraordinary
incident happened in the family of a clergyman
then living in Bartholomew Close.</p>

<p>The gentleman and his wife returning home
about eleven o'clock from a friend's house, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they had been to spend the evening, desired the
maid to get them warm water to mix with some
wine. There being no fire in the parlour, they
went into the kitchen; and while the water was
heating, the gentleman ordered the maid to get
a pan of coals, and warm the bed. The servant
had not long been gone up stairs, when the gentleman
and his wife heard an uncommon noise
over their heads, like persons walking without
shoes: and, presently after, a woman enters the
kitchen, without any other clothes on than her
shift and cap. Their astonishment at such a
sight so greatly frightened them, that they had
neither of them power to speak a word: and while
they were thus absorbed in amazement, another
woman entered the room in like manner. Just at
this time the maid came down from warming the
bed; and, though greatly surprised at so unexpected
an appearance, had the courage to ask them
who they were? and what they wanted? To which
they replied, that they were servants at their next-door
neighbour's, and, being awakened out of their
sleep by their master's calling out, Fire and thieves!
ran up stairs, and entering the garret window, came
down, to preserve themselves from danger, and
procure assistance. Upon this, inquiry being
made, the gentleman's daughter at the adjoining
house was found in violent fits, which occasioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
his calling the maids hastily to her assistance; and
this caused an alarm that had nearly proved fatal
to the clergyman's wife, who was, at that time,
far gone with child.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
PRUSSIAN DOMINO,<br />
<span class="xsm">OR</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>FATAL EFFECTS OF JEALOUSY</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> officer of rank in the service of the late King
of Prussia, having lost an amiable wife whom he
tenderly loved, became quite inconsolable. Deeply
wounded with his affliction, his mind was so absorbed
in melancholy, that the transient pleasures
of life were no longer a delight to him; he retired
from the court and the field, and at once secluded
himself from all society.</p>

<p>Among the numerous friends who lamented
his excessive sorrow, his Monarch was not the
least, who endeavoured to soothe his distracted
mind with sympathetic tenderness. Indeed, his
Majesty considered him not only an agreeable
companion, but a valuable friend; and was so
much interested in his behalf, that he was determined,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>if possible, to divert his immoderate grief.
But neither the promises of promotion, or the
threats of disgrace, could draw him from his retirement.
At length, after many zealous efforts
had proved ineffectual, a plan was suggested by
the King himself, which promised success. His
Majesty resolved to give a masquerade, to which,
by inviting Lindorf (for that was the officer's
name), an opportunity might be again taken to
entice him within that circle of gaiety, of which
he was once the admiration. The invitation being
accompanied with an affectionate and earnest solicitation
from the King, Lindorf could not refuse
accepting the offer; and, on the evening appointed,
he was once more seen in the rooms of splendour
and festivity. On his entrance he met the King,
who, after greeting him with great kindness, began
to rally him upon his late weakness. Lindorf
thanked his Majesty for the honour he did him,
and, after a short reply, they for some time walked
up and down the saloon together; when at length
it was agreed to part, that each might amuse himself
according to his own liking, with the different
characters exhibited that evening. But the King's
intention was solely to watch the movements of
Lindorf; for with heartfelt regret he beheld, as
they parted, the fixed melancholy that still brooded
on his countenance: and, when he beheld him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
pass, with downcast eyes, the saloon, where the
dance and music reigned with such irresistible
sway, all hope of reclaiming the unhappy widower
disappeared. For some time he was witness of
his melancholy deportment, and was much affected
to find that, where every face beamed a smile, the
countenance of Lindorf alone was sad and dejected.
The King, despairing of his project being
successful, was about to quit the rooms, when he
beheld Lindorf suddenly stop and speak to a lady
in a black domino. Rejoiced at this circumstance,
hope again revived, and he stayed his departure,
to watch the event.</p>

<p>Lindorf, when he quitted the King, continued
to walk up and down the rooms, nothing attracting
his attention but the lady in the black
domino, who, wherever he turned, always appeared
before him. At first he imagined the character
intended merely to amuse him, and that
her strange deportment was instigated by his
friends; but the unusual solemnity attending her
appearance, after he had in vain desired her to
desist, struck him with astonishment. He suddenly
stopped, and demanded who she was? "I
dare not tell you," answered the domino, in a deep
and plaintive tone of voice. Lindorf startled&mdash;his
blood ran cold; it was exactly the voice of his
deceased wife. "Who are you? for heaven's sake,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
tell me, or I die!" exclaimed Lindorf. "You will
be more wretched than you are, if I tell you," replied
the mysterious unknown, in accents that
doubly excited his curiosity. "Tell me," said he,
"I conjure you; for I cannot be more wretched
than I now am. Tell me all, and do not leave me
in this state of inquietude." "Know then," answered
the domino, "I am your wife." Lindorf
started&mdash;every nerve was wrung with anguish.
"Impossible," said he in a fright, "it cannot be;
yet the voice appears the same." Here his tongue
faltering, he ceased to speak. When he had
somewhat recovered his recollection, he ejaculated,
"In the name of God, do tell me who you are?
Is it a trick, or do I dream?" "Neither," replied
the unknown; and continued, in the same
tone of voice, to describe several particulars relative
to his family, and in what manner many things
were placed in the drawers belonging to his deceased
wife, which none but himself and the departed
knew of. At length he was convinced the
figure before him must be the apparition of his
wife; and, in the voice of anguish and despair,
requested she would unmask and let him see her
face. That the figure refused to do, saying, that
would be a sight he could not bear. "I can bear
any thing," he replied, "but the pain your denial
creates. I entreat you, let me see your face; do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
not refuse me!" Again she denied him; till at
last, by repeated entreaties, and his promises not
to be alarmed, she consented to unmask, and desired
him to follow her into an anti-room, solemnly
charging him not to give way to his feelings. They
then proceeded to the adjoining room.</p>

<p>The King, who was an eye-witness of the deep
conversation they were engaged in, beheld, with
rapture, their entrance into the anti-chamber, and
saw the door closed. "He is certainly restored,"
said the Monarch to his confidential attendant;
"Lindorf is most assuredly saved; he has made an
appointment with some pretty woman, and has
just retired to enjoy a private conversation. In
her endearments he will, I hope, forget his sorrows.
So we may now partake of the festivities of the
evening." Saying which, he immediately joined
the motley group with great cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Lindorf felt his blood chill, as the door of the
anti-chamber closed; but, the warmth of affection
returning, he no sooner entered, than he claimed
the dreadful promise. Again, in the most solemn
manner, she advised him not to urge that which
might tend to his misery, as she was certain he had
not sufficient fortitude to endure a sight of her.
With horror he heard the remonstrance; and the
solemnity of her deportment only inspired his eager
curiosity the more. At length, after many strict<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
injunctions, she lifted up the mask; when the astonished
Lindorf beheld the most horrid spectacle
of a skeleton head. "Oh, God!" he exclaimed,
and, groaning, fell senseless on the floor. In vain
the mysterious domino attempted to recover him.
Sorrow had for a long time preyed upon his existence,
and terror had now for ever quieted the unhappy
Lindorf. He breathed no more; he was a
lifeless corpse. Instantly the domino quitted the
room, and retired from the masquerade.</p>

<p>The King had just returned to his post of observation,
and saw the domino depart. In vain he
waited for Lindorf to follow; an hour expired, and
no Lindorf appeared. This raised the curiosity of
the Monarch. The door was left partly open, and
he resolved to enter; when, to his great surprise
and sorrow, he beheld Lindorf stretched on the
floor, a corpse. He instantly alarmed the company;
but the mystery of his death in vain they attempted
to develope. No marks of violence appeared on
his body, which was the more astonishing; and, to
add to the mystery, the masqued lady was not
to be found in any of the rooms. Messengers
were then dispatched, and advertisements distributed,
all over the city of Berlin, offering large
rewards for her apprehension; but no further information
could be gained, than that deposed by
two chairmen, who affirmed, they brought the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
domino to the rooms, which from their account
only added to the mystery.</p>

<p>Their declaration was as follows&mdash;"Having
received a letter, enjoining secrecy, and desiring
them to attend in the dusk of the evening, at a
certain church porch, to carry a lady to the
masquerade; they, thinking it was some person
who intended to play the character of a hobgoblin,
or sprite, did not hesitate, and made no farther
inquiry, but proceeded, at the hour appointed,
to the place mentioned; where they found a
person waiting in a black domino, just as the advertisement
described. On their arrival, without
speaking a word, the domino placed the money for
hire in their hands, and instantly entered the chair,
which they immediately conveyed to the masquerade.
On their arrival, without uttering a word,
she darted from them into the crowd, and they
saw no more of her until twelve o'clock, when, on
passing the door, they discovered the domino again
seated in the chair. They were much surprised
at such strange conduct; but, without reflecting on
the event, they conveyed her back again, as was
agreed, to the same church porch, when they received
a further gratuity, and departed." Such
was the deposition of the two chairmen, at once
mysterious and incomprehensible. This intelligence
still more astonished the King, who in vain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
used every method to make further discovery in
this extraordinary and unhappy affair.</p>

<p>Several years elapsed, without any thing occurring
that could lead to a developement of this
dreadful catastrophe. All search after the lady
was now given up, and nothing but the remembrance
of the unhappy affair remained. At length
the hour arrived, when this dreadful mystery was
explained, which displayed one of the most diabolical
and desperate transactions ever known.
The particulars are as follow.</p>

<p>A lady, then at the point of death, requested to
see some confidential friend of the King's; which
request was immediately complied with: to whom
she made the following confession. In accents
scarcely audible, she told them, she was the person
who appeared in the black domino, in so mysterious
a manner, to Lindorf, and which unhappily
caused his death. That revenge for neglected
love instigated her to play the part she did; but
that she had no idea the consequence would have
been so fatal: her intention being merely to assume
the appearance of his deceased wife, in order
that she might upbraid him, and gratify her revenge
for having broke his vow in marrying her
sister instead of herself; and also that she might
effectually persuade him to desist from his melancholy
intentions of remaining a widower, and prevail
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>on him to marry her&mdash;for although he refused
her request personally, yet she imagined the scheme
must be successful, when played off under the appearance
of a spirit of his deceased wife; and, to
deceive his imagination, she had endeavoured to
personify her; for which purpose she had procured
the head of a skeleton, and assumed that
character which had proved the death of the man
she so ardently loved, and the source of endless
misery to herself. She then related the conversation
that had passed between them on that
fatal evening, and fully described the whole particulars
of that mysterious affair. She likewise
acknowledged she endeavoured to imitate the voice
of his deceased wife; and declared her intention
for having the chair brought to the church porch
was to render the proceeding the more mysterious
and incomprehensible in case of a scrutiny. On
concluding this melancholy tale, she fetched a
deep sigh, and instantly expired.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
DEAD MAN<br />
<span class="xsm">AND</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>ANATOMICAL PROFESSOR</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span>, who were personally acquainted with
Mr. Junker, have frequently heard him relate the
following anecdote.</p>

<p>Being Professor of Anatomy, he once procured,
for dissection, the bodies of two criminals who had
been hanged. The key of the dissecting room
not being immediately at hand, when they were
carried home to him, he ordered them to be laid
down in a closet which opened into his own apartment.
The evening came; and Junker, according
to custom, proceeded to resume his literary labour
before he retired to rest. It was now near midnight,
and all his family were fast asleep, when he
heard a rumbling noise in his closet. Thinking
that, by some mistake, the cat had been shut up
with the dead bodies, he arose, and, taking the
candle, went to see what had happened. But
what must have been his astonishment, or rather
his panic, on perceiving that the sack which contained
the two bodies was rent through the middle.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
He approached, and found that one of them
was gone.</p>

<p>The doors and windows were well secured, and
he thought it impossible the bodies could have
been stolen. He tremblingly looked round the
closet, and observed the dead man seated in a
corner.</p>

<p>Junker stood for a moment motionless: the
dead man seemed to look towards him; he moved
both to the right and left, but the dead man still
kept his eyes upon him.</p>

<p>The Professor then retired, step by step, with
his eyes still fixed upon the object of his alarm,
and holding the candle in his hand, until he reached
the door. The dead man instantly started up,
and followed him. A figure of so hideous an appearance,
naked, and in motion&mdash;the lateness of
the hour&mdash;the deep silence which prevailed&mdash;every
thing concurred to overwhelm him with confusion.
He let fall the only candle which he had burning,
and all was darkness. He made his escape to
his bed-chamber, and threw himself on the bed:
thither, however, he was pursued; and he soon
felt the dead man embracing his legs, and loudly
sobbing. Repeated cries of "Leave me! leave me!"
released Junker from the grasp of the dead man;
who now exclaimed, "Ah! good executioner! good
executioner! have mercy upon me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p><p>Junker soon perceived the cause of what had
happened, and resumed his fortitude. He informed
the re-animated sufferer who he really was,
and made a motion, in order to call up some of the
family. "You wish then to destroy me," exclaimed
the criminal. "If you call any one, my
adventure will become public, and I shall be taken
and executed a second time. In the name of humanity,
I implore you to save my life."</p>

<p>The physician struck a light, decorated his
guest with an old night-gown, and, having made
him take off a cordial, requested to know what had
brought him to the gibbet. It would have been a
truly singular exhibition, observed Junker, to have
seen me, at that late hour, engaged in a <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with a dead man decked out in a night-gown.</p>

<p>The poor wretch informed him, that he had enlisted
as a soldier, but that, having no great attachment
to the profession, he had determined to desert;
that he had unfortunately entrusted his secret
to a kind of crimp, a fellow of no principle,
who recommended him to a woman, in whose
house he was to remain concealed: that this woman
had discovered his retreat to the officers of
police, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Junker was extremely perplexed how to save
the poor man. It was impossible to retain him in
his own house, and keep the affair a secret; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to turn him out of doors, was to expose him
to certain destruction. He therefore resolved to
conduct him out of the city, in order that he
might get into a foreign jurisdiction; but it was
necessary to pass the gates of the city, which were
strictly guarded. To accomplish this point, he
dressed the man in some of his old clothes, covered
him with a cloak, and, at an early hour, set out
for the country, with his <i>protegé</i> behind him. On
arriving at the city gate, where he was well known,
he said in a hurried tone, that he had been sent
for to visit a sick person who was dying in the
suburbs. He was permitted to pass. Having both
got into the open fields, the deserter threw himself
at the feet of his deliverer, to whom he vowed
eternal gratitude; and, after receiving some pecuniary
assistance, departed, offering up prayers for
his happiness.</p>

<p>Twelve years after, Junker, having occasion to
go to Amsterdam, was accosted on the Exchange
by a man well-dressed and of the best appearance,
who, he had been informed, was one of the most
respectable merchants in that city. The merchant,
in a polite manner, inquired whether he
was not Professor Junker of Halle; and, on being
answered in the affirmative, he requested, in an
earnest manner, his company to dinner. The
Professor consented. Having reached the merchant's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>house, he was shewn into an elegant apartment,
where he found a beautiful wife, and two
fine healthy children: but he could scarcely suppress
his astonishment at meeting with so cordial
a reception from a family with whom, he thought
he was entirely unacquainted.</p>

<p>After dinner, the merchant, taking him into his
counting-room, said, "You do not recollect me?"&mdash;"Not
at all."&mdash;"But I well recollect you; and
never shall your features be effaced from my remembrance.
You are my benefactor. I am the
person who came to life in your closet, and to
whom you paid so much attention. On parting
from you, I took the road to Holland. I wrote a
good hand, was tolerably expert at accounts; my
figure was somewhat interesting; and I soon obtained
employment as a merchant's clerk. My
good conduct, and my zeal for the interests of my
patron, procured me his confidence, and his
daughter's love. On his retiring from business, I
succeeded him, and became his son-in-law. But
for you, however, I should not have lived to experience
all these enjoyments. Henceforth, look
upon my house, my fortune, and myself, as at
your disposal."</p>

<p>Those who possess the smallest portion of sensibility
can easily represent to themselves the feelings
of Junker.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
DRUNKEN BUCKS,<br />
<span class="xsm">AND</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>CHIMNEY-SWEEP</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> March the 19th, 1765, four bucks assembled
at an inn in Grantham, to drink a glass, and play
a game of cards. The glass circulating very briskly,
before midnight they became so intoxicated, that
not one of them was able to determine how the
game stood; and several disputes, interspersed with
a considerable number of oaths, ensued, till they
agreed to let the cards lie, and endeavour to drink
themselves sober. Shortly after they resumed the
game; and each man imagining himself capable of
directing the rest, they soon came again to very
high words; when the waiter, fearful that some
bad consequences might ensue, let them know it
was near three o'clock, and, if any gentleman
pleased, he would wait on him home. Instead of
complying with his request, the geniuses looked
upon it as an indignity offered them, and declared,
with the most horrid imprecations, that not one of
them would depart till day-light. But, in the
height of their anger, an uncommon noise in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
chimney engaged their attention; when, on looking
towards the fire-place, a black spectre made
its appearance, and crying out in a hollow menacing
tone&mdash;"<i>My father has sent me for you,
infamous reprobates!</i>" They all, in the greatest
fright, flew out of the room, without staying to
take their hats, in broken accents confessing their
sins, and begging for mercy.</p>

<p>It appears, that the master of the inn, finding
he could not get rid of his troublesome guests, and
having a chimney-sweeper in his house sweeping
other chimneys, he gave the boy directions to descend
into the room as above related, whilst he
stood at a distance, and enjoyed the droll scene
of the bucks' flight.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
CRIPPLEGATE GHOST.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following story, well authenticated in the
neighbourhood of Cripplegate, will convince the
reader, that vicious intentions are sometimes productive
of much good to the parties they intended
to injure.</p>

<p>A gentlewoman in that parish, having lain for
some days in a trance, was at length laid out and
buried for dead, with a gold ring on her finger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The sexton knowing thereof, he and his wife, with
a lanthorn and candle, went privately the next
night, and dug up the coffin, opened it, untied
the winding sheet, and was going to cut off her
finger for the sake of the valuable ring buried with
her, they not being otherwise able to remove it;
when, suddenly, the lady raised herself up (being
just then supposed miraculously to come out of
her trance). The sexton and his wife ran away
in a horrible fright, leaving their lanthorn behind
them; which the lady took up, and made haste
home to her house. When knocking hard at the
door, the maid-servant asked who was there?
"'Tis I, your mistress," replied the lady; "and do,
for God's sake, let me in immediately, as I am
very cold." The maid, being much surprised and
terrified at this reply, neglected to open the door,
ran away to her master, and acquainted him with
the circumstance; who would scarcely believe
her tale, till he went himself to the door, and
heard his wife relate the dreadful particulars.
He immediately let her in, put her into a warm
bed; and, by being well looked after, she soon
perfectly recovered, and lived to have three children
afterwards.</p>

<p>This extraordinary resuscitation is conjectured,
by the faculty, to have been occasioned by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
sudden circulation of the blood on the villain's
attempting to cut off the finger.</p>

<p>A monument, with a curious inscription of this
affair, is still to be seen in Cripplegate church.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
VENTRILOQUIST.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following anecdotes are related by the Abbé
de la Chapelle, of the French Academy.</p>

<p>This gentleman, having heard many surprising
circumstances related concerning one Monsieur
St. Gille, a grocer, at St. Germain-en-Laye, near
Paris, whose astonishing powers as a ventriloquist
had given occasion to many singular and diverting
scenes, formed the resolution to see him. Struck
by the many marvellous anecdotes related concerning
him, the Abbé judged it necessary first to
ascertain the truth by the testimony of his own
senses, and then to inquire into the cause and manner
in which the phenomena were produced.</p>

<p>After some preparatory and necessary steps (for
Monsieur St. Gille had been told he did not chuse
to gratify the curiosity of every one), the Abbé
waited upon him, informed him of his design, and
was very cordially received. He was taken into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
parlour on the ground floor; when Monsieur St.
Gille and himself sat on the opposite sides of a
small fire, with only a table between them, the
Abbé keeping his eyes constantly fixed on Monsieur
St. Gille all the time. Half an hour had
passed, during which that gentleman diverted the
Abbé with a relation of many comic scenes which
he had given occasion to by this talent of his;
when, all on a sudden, the Abbé heard himself
called by his name and title, in a voice that
seemed to come from the roof of a house at
a distance. He was almost petrified with astonishment:
on recollecting himself, however, he
asked Monsieur St. Gille whether he had not
just then given him a specimen of his art? He
was answered only by a smile. But while the Abbé
was pointing to the house from which the voice
had appeared to him to proceed, his surprise was
augmented on hearing himself answered, "It was
not from that quarter," apparently in the same
kind of voice as before, but which now seemed to
issue from under the earth, at one of the corners
of the room. In short, this factitious voice played,
as it were, every where about him, and seemed to
proceed from any quarter or distance from which
the operator chose to transmit it to him. The
illusion was so very strong, that, prepared as the
Abbé was for this kind of conversation, his mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
senses were absolutely incapable of undeceiving
him. Though conscious that the voice proceeded
from the mouth of Monsieur St. Gille, that gentleman
appeared absolutely mute while he was exercising
this talent; nor could the author perceive
any change whatever in his countenance. He observed,
however, at this first visit, that Monsieur
St. Gille contrived, but without any affectation, to
present only the profile of his face to him, while
he was speaking as a ventriloquist.</p>

<p>The next experiment made was no less curious
than the former, and is related as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>Monsieur St. Gille, returning home from a place
where his business had carried him, sought for
shelter from an approaching thunder-storm, in a
neighbouring convent. Finding the whole community
in mourning, he inquires the cause, and is
told, that one of their body had lately died, who
was the ornament and delight of the whole society.
To pass away the time, he walks into the church,
attended by some of the religious, who shew him
the tomb of their deceased brother, and speak
feelingly of the scanty honours they had bestowed
on his memory. Suddenly, a voice is heard, apparently
proceeding from the roof of the choir, lamenting
the situation of the deceased in purgatory,
and reproaching the brotherhood with their lukewarmness
and want of zeal on his account. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
friars, as soon as their astonishment gave them
power to speak, consult together, and agree to acquaint
the rest of the community with this singular
event, so interesting to the whole society.</p>

<p>Monsieur St. Gille, who wished to carry on the
deception still farther, dissuaded them from taking
this step; telling them, that they will be treated by
their absent brethren as a set of fools and visionaries.
He recommended to them, however, the
immediately calling the whole community into the
church, when the ghost of their departed brother
may, probably, reiterate his complaints. Accordingly,
all the friars, novices, lay-brothers, and even
the domestics of the convent, are immediately
summoned and collected together. In a short
time, the voice from the roof renewed its lamentations
and reproaches; and the whole convent fell
on their faces, and vowed a solemn reparation. As
a first step, they chaunted a <i>De Profundis</i> in full
choir; during the intervals of which, the ghost
occasionally expressed the comfort he received
from their pious exercises and ejaculations on his
behalf. When all was over, the Prior entered into
a serious conversation with Monsieur St. Gille;
and, on the strength of what had just passed, sagaciously
inveighed against the absurd incredulity
of our modern sceptics, and pretended philosophers,
as to the existence of ghosts or apparitions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Monsieur St. Gille thought it now high time to
undeceive the good fathers. This purpose, however,
he found extremely difficult to effect, till he
had prevailed upon them to return with him into
the church, and there be witnesses of the manner
in which he had conducted this ludicrous deception.</p>

<p>In consequence of these memoirs, presented by
the author to the Royal Academy of Sciences at
Paris, in which he communicated to them the observations
that he had collected on the subject of
ventriloquism in general, and those he had made
on Monsieur St. Gille in particular; that learned
body deputed two of its members, M. de Fouchy
and Le Roi, to accompany him to St. Germain-en-Laye,
in order to verify the facts, and to make their
observations on the nature and causes of this extraordinary
faculty. In the course of this inquiry,
a very singular plan was laid and executed, to put
Monsieur St. Gille's powers of deception to the
trial, by engaging him to exert them in the presence
of a large party, consisting of the commissaries of the
Academy, and some persons of the highest quality,
who were to dine in the open forest near St. Germain-en-Laye
on a particular day. All the members
of this party were in the secret, except a certain
lady, here designated by the title of the Countess
de B. who was pitched upon as a proper person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
for Monsieur St. Gille's delusive powers, as she
knew nothing either of him or of ventriloquism;
and possibly for another reason, which the Abbé,
through politeness, suppresses. She had been told
in general, that this party had been formed in consequence
of a report, that an aërial spirit had
lately established itself in the forest of St. Germain-en-Laye;
and that a grand deputation from
the Academy of Sciences was to pass the day
there, to inquire into the reality of the fact.</p>

<p>Monsieur St. Gille was one of the first of this
select party; and, previous to his joining the
company in the forest, he completely deceived
one of the Commissaries of the Academy, who
was then walking apart from the rest, and whom he
accidentally met. Just as he was abreast of him,
prepared and guarded as the academician was
against a deception of this kind, he verily believed
that he heard his associate M. de Fouchy, who
was then with the company at above an hundred
yards distance, calling after him to return as expeditiously
as possible. His valet, too, after repeating
to his master the purport of M. de Fouchy's
supposed acclamation, turned about towards
the company, and, with the greatest simplicity
imaginable, bawled out as loud as he could, in
answer to him, "Yes, Sir."</p>

<p>After this promising beginning, the party sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
down to dinner; and the aërial spirit, who had
been previously furnished with proper anecdotes
respecting the company, soon began to address
the Countess of B. particularly, in a voice that
seemed to be in the air over their heads. Sometimes
he spoke to her from the tops of the trees
around them, or from the surface of the ground,
but at a great distance; and at other times seemed
to speak from a considerable depth under her feet.
During the dinner, the spirit appeared to be absolutely
inexhaustible in the gallantries he addressed
to her; though he sometimes said civil things to
the rest of the company. This kind of conversation
lasted above two hours; and, in fine, the
Countess was firmly persuaded, as the rest of the
company affected to be, that this was the voice of
an aërial spirit: nor would she, as the author affirms,
have been undeceived, had not the rest of
the company, by their unguarded behaviour, at
length excited in her some suspicions. The little
plot against her was then owned; and she acknowledged
herself to be mortified only in being
awakened from such a pleasing delusion.</p>

<p>Several other instances of Monsieur St. Gille's
talents are related. He is not, however, the only
ventriloquist now in being. The author, in the
course of his inquiries on this subject, was informed
that the Baron de Mengin, a German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
nobleman, possessed this art in a very high degree.
The Baron has also constructed a little puppet,
or doll, (the lower jaw of which he moves by a
particular contrivance), with which he holds a
spirited kind of dialogue. In the course of it, the
little virago is so impertinent, that at last he
thrusts her into his pocket; from whence she
seems, to those present, to grumble, and complain
of her hard treatment. Some time ago, the Baron,
who was then at the court of Bareith, being in
company with the Prince de Deux Ponts, and
other noblemen, amused them with this scene. An
Irish officer, who was then present, was so firmly
persuaded that the Baron's doll was a real living
animal, previously taught by him to repeat these
responses, that he watched his opportunity at the
close of the dialogue, and suddenly made an attempt
to snatch it from his pocket. The little
doll, as if in danger of being suffocated, during
the struggle occasioned by this attempt, called out
for help, and screamed incessantly from the
pocket till the officer desisted. She then became
silent; and the Baron was obliged to take her out
from thence, to convince him, by handling her,
that she was a mere piece of wood.</p>

<p>It should have been observed, at the beginning
of the Abbé's anecdotes, that ventriloquism is
the art of vocal deception. It is an art, or quality,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
possessed by certain persons, by means of which
they are enabled to speak inwardly, having the
power of forming speech by drawing the air into
the lungs, and to modify the voice in such a manner
as to make it seem to proceed from any distance,
or in any direction whatever.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but many of these deceptions
have been magnified by weak people into those
dreadful stories of apparitions and hobgoblins,
which the credulous and enthusiastic are too apt
implicitly to believe.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
SCHOOL-BOY APPARITION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> years since, the inhabitants of Dorking,
in Surrey, entertained a notion, that a ghost walked
in a certain place in that neighbourhood; and that
she (for it was an ancient lady, lately dead) was
seen hovering about the mansion-house, which was
left uninhabited for some time; that she would be up
and down in the house very often in the day-time,
making a rumbling and a clattering noise; and
in the night-time she walked in the neighbouring
fields, with a candle in her hand, and though the
wind blew ever so hard, it would not blow the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
candle out; that sometimes she would appear in
the open fields, sometimes up in the trees; and,
in particular, there was a little heath near Dorking,
called Cotman Dean, where, it was said, she was
frequently seen.</p>

<p>There was a boarding-school of boys in that
town, some of whom were particularly roguish,
and contrived all this walking, from the beginning
to the end. First, they got a small rope; and,
tying one end of it to an old chair which stood in
an upper room of the house (for they had found
the means to get in and out of the house at pleasure),
they brought the other end of the rope down
on the other side of the house, in a private place,
where it could not easily be seen; and by this they
pulled the old chair up, and then let it fall down
again: this made a great noise in the house, and
was heard distinctly by many of the neighbours.
Then other boys of the same gang took care to
call out the old women in the next houses, that
now they might hear the old lady playing her
pranks; and, accordingly, they would all assemble
in the court-yard, where they could plainly hear
the noises, but not one of them would venture to
go up stairs. If any one offered to go a little way
up, then all was quiet; but, as soon as ever they
retired, the rumbling would begin again. This
was the day's deception.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p><p>In the night, one of these unlucky boys got a
dark lanthorn, which was a thing, at that time,
the country-people did not understand; and with
this he walked about the orchard, and two or
three closes near the house, shewing the light in
different directions. His comrades would then
call all the old women about them to see it. Then,
on a sudden, the light would seem to go out, as
the boy closed up the lanthorn. Then he would
run swiftly across the whole field, and shew his
light again on the other side. Now he would be
up in a tree, then in the road, then upon the middle
of the heath; so that the country-people made no
more question, but that the old lady walked with
a candle in her hand, and that they saw the light
of it; in a word, it passed for an apparition, and
was generally conceived as such by the neighbourhood,
till the knavery was discovered, the boys
punished, and the towns-people laughed at for
their credulity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
CREDULOUS PEASANTS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> longer ago than the year 1788, when the husbandmen
of Paris suffered so severely by the devastation
on the 13th of July in that year, many
of the farmers were positively so superstitious
at their own created fears, that, notwithstanding
considerable sums were offered to indemnify them
for their losses, and to encourage them to carry
on with spirit the cultivation of their lands, with
new seeds, new implements, &amp;c. they peremptorily
refused, on account of a foolish report that was
then prevalent in some parts of the country where
the storm happened. They said, that two giants
were seen peeping out of the clouds, and threatening,
with terrible countenances, gigantic frowns,
and high-sounding words, that they would return
next year on the same thirteenth day of July, with
a greater scourge than they then felt. Terrified
either at the imagined report, or at the fancied
sight of the giants (which terror and a weak brain
will often produce), many of the unhappy sufferers
abandoned their houses, and commenced beggars,
rather than return to the labours of the field: so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
great was their affright, in consequence of that
tremendous storm.</p>

<p>This story, though hardly credible, may be depended
on as a fact, and may be seen in many of
the public prints of that time.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
NOCTURNAL DISTURBERS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following authentic story is related by Dr.
Plot, in his Natural History of Oxfordshire.</p>

<p>Soon after the murder of King Charles the First,
a commission was appointed to survey the King's
house at Woodstock, with the manor, park, woods,
and other demesnes thereunto belonging; and one
Collins, under a feigned name, hired himself as
Secretary to the Commissioners: who, upon the
thirteenth of October 1849, met, and took up their
residence in the King's own rooms. His Majesty's
bed-chamber they made their kitchen; the council-hall,
their pantry; and the presence-chamber was
the place where they sat for the dispatch of business.
His Majesty's dining room they made their
wood-yard, and stored it with the wood of the famous
royal oak, from the high park; which, that
nothing might be left with the name of the King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
about it, they had dug up by the roots, and split,
and bundled up into faggots for their firing.</p>

<p>Things being thus prepared, they sat on the 16th
of the same month for the dispatch of business; and
in the midst of their first debate, there entered a
large black dog, as they thought, which made a
dreadful howling, overturned two or three of their
chairs, and then crept under a bed, and vanished.
This gave them the greater surprise, as the doors
were kept constantly locked, so that no real dog
could get in or out. The next day, their surprise
was increased; when, sitting at dinner in a lower
room, they heard plainly the noise of persons
walking over their heads, though they well knew
the doors were all locked, and there could be nobody
there. Presently after, they heard also all
the wood of the King's oak brought by parcels
from the dining-room, and thrown with great violence
into the chamber; as also the chairs, stools,
tables, and other furniture, forcibly hurled about
the room; their own papers of the minutes of their
transactions torn; and the ink-glass broken. When
this noise had some time ceased, Giles Sharp, their
Secretary, proposed to enter first into these rooms;
and, in presence of the Commissioners, of whom
he received the key, he opened the doors, and
found the wood spread about the room, the chairs
tossed about, and broken, the papers torn, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
ink-glass broken (as has been said); but not the
least track of any human creature, nor the least
reason to suspect one, as the doors were all fast,
and the keys in the custody of the Commissioners.
It was therefore unanimously agreed, that the
power who did this mischief must have entered
the room at the key-hole.</p>

<p>The night following, Sharp, the Secretary,
with two of the Commissioners' servants, as
they were in bed in the same room (which
room was contiguous to that where the Commissioners
lay), had their beds' feet lifted so much
higher than their heads, that they expected to
have their necks broken; and then they were
let fall at once with so much violence, as shook
the whole house, and more than ever terrified the
Commissioners.</p>

<p>On the night of the nineteenth, as all were
in bed in the same room for greater safety,
and lights burning by them, the candles in an
instant went out with a sulphurous smell: and,
that moment, many trenchers of wood were hurled
about the room; which, next morning, were found
to be the same their Honours had eaten off the day
before, which were all removed from the pantry,
though not a lock was found opened in the whole
house. The next night, they fared still worse:
the candles went out as before; the curtains of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
their Honours' beds were rattled to and fro with
great violence; their Honours received many cruel
blows and bruises by eight great pewter dishes, and
a number of wooden trenchers, being thrown on
their beds, which being heaved off were heard rolling
about the room, though in the morning none of
them were to be seen. The following night, likewise,
they were alarmed with the tumbling down
of oaken billets about their beds, and other frightful
noises: but all was clear in the morning, as if no
such thing had happened. The next night, the
keeper of the King's house and his dog lay in the
Commissioners' room; and then they had no disturbance.
But, on the night of the twenty-second,
though the dog lay in the room as before, yet the
candles went out, a number of brickbats fell from
the chimney into the room, the dog howled piteously,
their bed-clothes were all stripped off, and
their terror increased. On the twenty-fourth
night, they thought all the wood of the King's oak
was violently thrown down by their bed-sides;
they counted sixty-four billets that fell, and some
hit and shook the beds in which they lay: but in
the morning none were found there, nor had the
door been opened where the billet-wood was kept.
The next night, the candles were put out, the curtains
rattled, and a dreadful crack like thunder
was heard; and one of the servants, running to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
see if his master was not killed, found three dozen
of trenchers laid smoothly under the quilt by
him.</p>

<p>But all this was nothing to what succeeded afterwards.
The twenty-ninth, about midnight, the
candles went out; something walked majestically
through the room, and opened and shut the windows;
great stones were thrown violently into the
room, some of which fell on the beds, others on
the floor; and, about a quarter after one, a noise
was heard, as of forty cannon discharged together,
and again repeated at about eight minutes distance.
This alarmed and raised all the neighbourhood;
who, coming into their Honours' rooms, gathered
up the great stones, fourscore in number,
and laid them in the corner of a field, where, in Dr.
Plot's time, who reported this story, they were to
be seen. This noise, like the discharge of cannon,
was heard through all the country for sixteen
miles round. During these noises, which were
heard in both rooms together, the Commissioners
and their servants gave one another over for lost,
and cried out for help; and Giles Sharp, snatching
up a sword, had well nigh killed one of their
Honours, mistaking him for the spirit, as he came
in his shirt, from his own room to their's. While
they were together, the noise was continued, and
part of the tiling of the house was stripped off,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and all the windows of an upper room were taken
away with it.</p>

<p>On the thirtieth at midnight, something walked
into the chamber, treading like a bear; it walked
many times about, then threw a warming-pan violently
on the floor: at the same time a large quantity
of broken glass, accompanied with great
stones and horses' bones, came pouring into the
room, with uncommon force; these were all found
in the morning, to the astonishment and terror of
the Commissioners, who were yet determined to
go on with their business.</p>

<p>But, on the first of November, the most dreadful
scene of all ensued. Candles in every part of
the house were lighted up, and a great fire made.
At midnight, the candles all yet burning, a noise,
like the burst of a cannon, was heard in the room,
and the burning billets were tossed about by it
even into their Honours' beds, who called Giles
and his companions to their relief, otherwise the
house had been burned to the ground. About an
hour after, the candles went out as usual; the
crack of as many cannon was heard; and many
pailfuls of green stinking water were thrown upon
their Honours' beds; great stones were thrown in,
as before; the bed-curtains and bedsteads torn
and broken; the windows shattered; and the
whole neighbourhood alarmed with the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
dreadful noises; nay, the very rabbit-stealers that
were abroad that night in the warren, were so terrified,
that they fled for fear, and left their ferrets
behind them. One of their Honours, this night,
spoke; and, in the name of God, asked what it
was? and why it disturbed them so? No answer
was given to this, but the noise ceased for a while;
when the spirit came again, and, as they all agreed,
brought with it seven devils worse than itself. One
of the servants now lighted a large candle, and
placed himself in the doorway between the two
chambers, to see what passed; and, as he watched,
he plainly saw a hoof striking the candle and candlestick
into the middle of the room, and afterwards
making three scrapes over the snuff, scraped
it out. Upon this the same person was so bold as
to draw a sword; but he had scarce got it out,
when he felt an invisible hand had hold of it too,
and pulled with him for it, and, at length prevailing,
struck him so violently on the head with
the hilt, that he fell down for dead with the blow.
At this instant was heard another burst, like the
discharge of the broadside of a ship of war; and,
at about a minute or two's distance each, no less
than nineteen more such. These shook the house
so violently, that they expected every moment it
would fall upon their heads. The neighbours, on
this, as has been said, being all alarmed, flocked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to the house in great numbers, and all joined in
prayer and psalm-singing; during which the noise
still continued in the other rooms, and the report
of cannon was heard, as from without, though no
visible agent was seen to discharge them.</p>

<p>But what was the most alarming of all, and put
an end to their proceedings effectually, happened
the next day, as they were all at dinner; when a
paper, in which they had signed a mutual agreement
to reserve a part of the premises out of the
general survey, and afterwards to share it equally
amongst them, (which paper they had hid, for the
present, under the earth, in a pot in one corner of
the room, in which an orange-tree grew), was
consumed in a wonderful manner, by the earth's
taking fire, with which the pot was filled, and
burning violently with a blue flame, and an intolerable
stench, so that they were all driven out of
the house, to which they could never again be
prevailed upon to return.</p>

<p>This wonderful contrivance was all the invention
of the memorable Joseph Collins, of Oxford,
otherwise called <i>Funny Joe</i>; who, having hired
himself for their Secretary, under the name of
Giles Sharp, by knowing the private traps belonging
to the house, and the help of <i>pulvis fulminans</i>
and other chemical preparations, and letting his
fellow-servants into the scheme, carried on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
deceit, without discovery, to the very last, so dextrously,
that the late Dr. Plot, in his Natural
History, relates the whole for fact, in the gravest
manner.</p>

<h2>MARESCHAL SAXE,<br />
<span class="xsm">AND</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>THE HAUNTED CASTLE</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following very remarkable adventure, which
befel the Mareschal de Saxe, whilst returning to
his country-seat, near Dresden, in Saxony, has
often been related by him to his friends and acquaintance;
and, as the Mareschal was not less
famed for his love of truth, than for his heroic
courage as a warrior, none of them ever doubted
the truth of his relation.</p>

<p>"Returning," says the Mareschal, "from the
fatigues of a very active campaign to my country-seat,
in order to seek, in retirement, some relaxation
during the remainder of the winter, I arrived
on the third day at a small village, on the verge
of an extensive forest. At about half a league
from this village, stood an ancient castle, in which
some of the country-people were usually wont to
take up their abode, and from which they had of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
late been driven, according to their account, by
the nightly appearance of a most terrific spectre,
whose visit was announced by the most hideous
groans. On conversing with some of the villagers,"
observes the Mareschal, "I found that an universal
terror pervaded the whole neighbourhood;
many of them declaring they had actually seen
the dreadful ghost; whilst others, taking their
declaration for granted, promulgated the story,
according as their imaginations were more or less
affected by their fears.</p>

<p>"Willing, if possible, to comfort these poor
people, and to convince them that their senses
were deceived, I told them they were wrong to
suffer their fears to get the better of their reason;
and that, if any of them had the courage to examine
more closely into the affair, they would find
the whole was nothing more than some imposture,
or the effusion of a superstitious brain, or, at most,
a trick played upon them by some wicked people
on purpose to amuse themselves by sporting with
their feelings. But I was much disappointed to
find that my arguments had but little effect. I
therefore determined, if possible, to trace the
affair to the bottom before I departed, in order
to dispel their fears, and do away the unfavourable
impression they had so generally entertained of
the castle being haunted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p><p>"I now told them, I would pass a night in one
of the apartments of the castle, provided I were
furnished with a bed, and other necessaries requisite
for such an undertaking. 'Moreover,' said I,
'if this ghostly personage should honour me with
a visit, I shall not fail to propose articles of accommodation
between you.' To this they readily
assented, and seemed much pleased with my proposition.</p>

<p>"In the evening, my bed, fire, and other requisites,
being ready, I was conducted to my new
abode; on entering which, I proposed to some of
my conductors to pass the night with me, which
they, one and all, declined, under various pretences.
'Well then, my good people,' said I, rallying
their want of courage, 'the day is now
closing apace, I would have you return immediately,
lest this nightly intruder should intercept
you in your retreat.' Whereupon my companions
took leave, and hastened with all speed from the
castle.</p>

<p>"Being now alone, I thought it prudent to
examine the castle with the most minute circumspection.
After various researches to discover all
the private avenues of the place, I returned to the
apartment I proposed sleeping in, at the further
end of which I perceived a door that till now I
had not discovered. I essayed to open it, but in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
vain, as it was fastened on the other side. This
naturally excited my suspicion. I again made the
attempt, and again was unsuccessful. I then prepared
to guard myself against a surprise; I therefore
charged my pistols, and laid them together
with my sword in a convenient place to seize them
on the least alarm. I then took a slight repast, of
such provisions as had been prepared for me;
after which I amused myself, until my usual hour
of going to rest, with examining the Gothic decorations
of my apartment, and then laid me down
on the bed, and, being rather overcome with the
fatigue of the day, I soon sunk into a profound
sleep. How long I continued in this state, I cannot
exactly say; but I conjectured it to be about
midnight, when I was alarmed with the most unaccountable
noise I had ever heard. I listened a
few seconds, to ascertain from whence the sound
came, and soon found it proceeded from without
the door I had fruitlessly attempted to open. I
instantly jumped from the bed, seized my arms,
and was in the act of advancing towards it, determined
to find out the cause of this disturbance,
let what would be the consequence; when, suddenly
the door flew open, with the most tremendous
crash. A hollow groan issued from the
vaults below; and a tall figure of gigantic appearance,
clad in complete armour, rose to my view.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
The figure's appearance was so sudden and terrific,
that I could not in a moment collect myself sufficiently
to call out and speak to it; but, a moment
after, my courage returned, and, calling to mind,
that I could only find safety in my own courageous
efforts, and not doubting but the intruder was a
mortal like myself, I instantly levelled one of my
pistols, and fired. The ball struck the breast-plate
of the figure, glided quickly off, and lodged
in the wall. I levelled again, fired, and with the
same effect. I then drew my sword, at the same
time exclaiming, 'Know that I am the Mareschal
de Saxe; that I am a stranger to fear, and that this
sword shall quickly prove whether thou art mortal
or not!' 'Be thou the Mareschal de Saxe, or
the devil,' replied the figure; 'thy courage here
can avail thee nought. I have the means to destroy
thee, or an hundred such, in an instant. But,
follow me; thy obedience only can insure thy
safety.' I now saw that resistance would be vain,
as several figures clad in armour like the first, and
well armed, appeared at each door. 'Well then,'
said I, 'since it is so, lead the way; but remember,
that the first who dares touch me dies, if my
own life is the immediate forfeiture.'</p>

<p>"We then quitted the apartment, by the secret
door already mentioned; and, descending by a
circuitous flight of stairs, soon arrived at another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
door, which flew open on our approach. No
sooner were we entered, than my guide gave a
signal to those who followed, and the door was
instantly shut. A number of Vulcan-like creatures
now appeared, bearing lighted torches, and leading
the way through a winding subterraneous passage.
We soon came to a spacious arched vault,
in which I beheld upwards of fifty persons very
actively engaged in the various processes of coining.
The whole mystery was now developed;
and I discovered that, for the first time in my life,
I had fallen into the hands of a most desperate
gang of coiners. Escape was now utterly impossible;
nor could I entertain the most distant hope
of succour from without the castle, as my sudden
disappearance would rather operate to confirm
the terror of the villagers, than stimulate them to
search after me.</p>

<p>"The man in armour now turned to me, and
addressed me in nearly the following words&mdash;'You
now see for what purpose we are here
arrived. I am the chief of this band; and it is
principally to me you may attribute your preservation.
We have but recently taken up our abode
in this castle; and the plan we have fallen upon
to terrify the villagers and country round, and
thereby keep them from pursuing us, has hitherto
succeeded beyond our most sanguine expectations;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
nor was it likely we should have been disturbed
for years to come, had you not visited these parts.
Of your resolute intention to sleep in the haunted
apartment we were informed by our friends without;
your name also was made known to us; upon
which an universal consternation ensued. Many
wished to fly, in order to avoid, what they conceived,
inevitable destruction: others were of opinion,
it would be better to suffer you to enter the
castle quietly; and as, most likely you would be
attended with but few persons, to dispatch you all
in the night, and hide your bodies among the ruins
in one of the vaults. This last proposition had
the majority; as it was considered, that our own
safety would not only be secured for the present
by this act, but it would in all probability prevent
others from making the like attempt hereafter.
But this proceeding was happily over-ruled by me
and a few others&mdash;I say, happily; for though we
are considered, in the eye of the law, as co-brothers
with assassins and midnight robbers, yet God forbid
that we should add to our crimes by staining
our hands with the blood of the innocent. To be
brief, I promised that, with the aid of a few of my
companions, I would drive you from the castle by
the same stratagem I have before made use of to
others, or, if that did not succeed, to secure and
conduct you by force. Thus have I explained the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
cause of your present detention. The regaining
your liberty must entirely depend on your acquiescence
with our proposals; and there is a way I
can point out, by which you may secure both your
own safety and our's.' 'Name it not then,' said I, interrupting
him, 'if it be dishonourable; for I had
rather perish here by your hands, than owe my
liberty to any connivance at your iniquities, or be
the instrument of your future security!' 'Use your
own pleasure,' continued he, in a determined tone
of voice; 'but you certainly must not depart this
place until you have bound yourself by your <i>honour</i>
not to divulge a secret, on which depend the lives
of so many persons. That word, once pledged
by the Mareschal de Saxe, will be a sufficient guarantee
of our future safety. I could have wished
our request had been more congenial to your feelings;
but our situation is desperate, and consequently
impels us to enforce, what we would,
under all other circumstances, have solicited as
the least of favours&mdash;your word of honour.</p>

<p>"I paused for several minutes: a confused murmur
now run throughout the whole place, and an
universal disapprobation at the chief's forbearance
began now to manifest itself. Add to which, I saw
the utter impracticability of escape without complying
with their demand; and I knew that their
prepossession in my favour was but partial, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
course might soon give way to their former plan of
assassinating me for their safety. If I continued
inflexible, I perceived my death was inevitable.
Therefore, as the majority were favourably inclined,
I made a virtue of necessity, and gave them
my word to keep the secret of the whole affair
locked within my own breast. 'You are now at
liberty,' said the chief, 'to return to your apartment,
where you may rely on being perfectly safe
until break of day, when you had better depart.'
Whereupon the doors flew open, and I was conducted
back to my old lodging, where I sat ruminating
on the strangeness of the adventure.</p>

<p>"Day now appearing, I quitted the castle, and
hied me to the village, where I found most of the
inhabitants already in waiting, eager to hear how
I made out with the ghost. Numberless were
their interrogatories, which I only answered by
telling them I was not at liberty to disclose what
I had seen and heard. Their old opinions were
now more fully confirmed than ever; and, I believe,
from that moment none have had courage to venture
near the castle after dark; and it is probable
that, to this day, the whole mystery has never
been truly explained to their satisfaction. Shortly
after, I set out on my journey, and soon arrived in
safety at my own domain.</p>

<p>"About four years after this, a person rode up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
my gate, leading a couple of beautiful chargers,
which he delivered, with a letter addressed to me,
into the hands of my domestics; and, having so
done, he clapped spurs to his horse, and disappeared
in an instant. On opening the letter, I
found it contained nearly the following words&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
'<i>From the pretended Ghost of the Haunted Castle,
to the Mareschal de Saxe.</i></p>

<p>'Brave Mareschal&mdash;You are now at liberty to
divulge the secret of our affair in the haunted
castle. Our fortunes are now made; and, ere
you receive this, we shall be far from hence.
But remember, that whatever the world may say
as to the propriety of keeping your word with
men like us, know, that the honour of a prince<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>,
once pledged, should be kept inviolate, even
though given in a bad cause. My companions
desired me to beg your acceptance of the horses
you will receive herewith, as a mark of their
most grateful acknowledgments. Adieu! May
you live long, and be happy.'&mdash;"</p>

<h2>REMARKABLE RESUSCITATION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first volume of the <cite>Causes Célèbres</cite>, a popular
French work, is the following extraordinary
story, which occasioned a serious law-suit.</p>

<p>Two men in trade, who lived in the street St.
Honoré in Paris, nearly equal in circumstances,
both following the same profession, and united in
the closest friendship, had each of them a child,
much about the same age. These children were
brought up together, and conceived a mutual attachment,
which, ripening with years into a stronger
and more lively sentiment, was approved by the
parents on both sides. This young couple was
upon the point of being made happy, by a more
solemn union, when a rich financier, conceiving a
passion for the young maiden, unfortunately crossed
their inclinations by demanding her in marriage.
The allurements of a more brilliant fortune seduced
her father and mother, notwithstanding
their daughter's repugnance, to consent to the
change. To their entreaties, however, she was
obliged to yield, and sacrificed her affections by
becoming the wife of the financier. Like a woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>of virtue, she forbade her earlier lover the
house. A fit of melancholy, the consequence of
this violence done to her inclinations by entering
into an engagement of interest, brought on her a
malady, which so far benumbed her faculties, that
at length she was given over by the faculty, apparently
died, and was accordingly laid out for burial.</p>

<p>Her former lover, who had once before beheld
her in a similar situation, flattered himself that he
might possibly again find her in a trance. This
idea not only suspended his grief, but prompted
him to bribe the grave-digger, by whose aid he
dug up the body in the night-time, and conveyed
it home. He then used every means in his power
for recalling her to life, and was overjoyed on discovering
that his endeavours were not ineffectual.</p>

<p>It is not easy to conceive the surprise of the
young woman on her resuscitation, when she found
herself in a strange house, and, as it were, in the
arms of her lover, who soon informed her of what
had taken place on her account. She then comprehended
the extent of her obligation to her
deliverer; and love, more pathetic than all his
persuasions to unite their destinies, determined
her, on her recovery, to escape with him into
England. This was effected; and they lived for
some years in the closest union.</p>

<p>At the end of ten years, they conceived the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
natural wish of revisiting their own country, and
at length returned to Paris, where they took no
precaution whatever of concealing themselves,
being persuaded that no suspicion would attach
to their arrival. It happened however, by chance,
that the financier met his wife in one of the public
walks. The sight of her made so strong an impression
on him, that for some time he imagined
it must be her apparition; and, being fully persuaded
of her death, he could not for a long time
efface that idea. However, he so contrived it as
to join her; and, notwithstanding the language
she made use of to impose upon him, he left her
with the conviction that he was not deceived at
finding her a living substance.</p>

<p>The singularity of this event gave more charms
to the woman in the eyes of her former husband
than she before possessed. He therefore acted with
such address, that he discovered her abode, notwithstanding
all her precautions, and reclaimed
her with all the regular formalities of justice.</p>

<p>It was in vain that the lover maintained the
right which his cares for his mistress gave him to
the possession of her; that he represented her
inevitable death but for him; that his adversary
divested himself of all his own rights, by causing
her to be buried; that he ought even to be accused
of homicide, for want of having taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
proper precautions to assure himself of her death;
and a thousand other ingenious reasons, which love
suggested to him. But, finding that the judicial
ear was unfavourable, and not thinking it expedient
to wait the result of a definitive judgment, he fled
with his mistress into a foreign country; where
they passed the remainder of their days without
further molestation.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
CREDULOUS BISHOP.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> years since, a memorable conference took
place between Dr. Fowler (then Bishop of Gloucester)
and a Mr. Justice Powell: the former, a
zealous defender of ghosts; and the latter, somewhat
sceptical about them. They had several altercations
upon the subject; and once, when the
Bishop made a visit to the Justice, the latter, contracting
the muscles of his face into an air of more
than usual severity, assured the Bishop, that, since
their last disputation, besides his Lordship's strong
reasons, he had met with no less proof than ocular
demonstration, to convince him of the real existence
of ghosts. "How!" says the Bishop, "ocular
demonstration! Well, I have preached, I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
printed, upon the subject; but nothing will convince
you sceptics but ocular demonstration. I
am glad, Mr. Justice, you are become a convert.
But pray, Sir, how went this affair? I beseech you,
let me know the whole story." "My Lord," answered
the Justice, "as I lay one night in my bed,
and had gone through the better half of my first
sleep, it being about twelve o'clock, on a sudden I
was awakened by a very strange and uncommon
noise, and heard something coming up stairs, and
stalking directly towards my room. I had the
courage to raise myself upon my pillow, and to
draw the curtain, just as I heard my chamber-door
open, and saw a glimmering light enter my chamber."
"Of a blue colour, no doubt," says the
Bishop. "Of a pale blue," answers the Justice.
"But, permit me, my good Lord, to proceed.
The light was followed by a tall, meagre, and
stern personage, who seemed to be of the age of
seventy, in a long dangling rug gown, bound
round his loins with a broad leathern girdle; his
beard was thick and grizzly; he had a large fur
cap on his head, and a long staff in his hand; his
face was full of wrinkles, and seemed to be of a
dark and sable hue. I was struck with the appearance
of so surprising a figure, and felt some
shocks which I had never before been acquainted
with. Soon after the spectre had entered my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
room, with a hasty, but somewhat stately pace,
it drew near my bed, and stared me full in the
face." "And did you not speak to it?" interrupted
the Bishop, with a good deal of emotion.
"With submission, my Lord," says the Justice,
"please only to indulge me in a few words more."
"But, Mr. Justice, Mr. Justice," replies the Bishop
still more hastily, "you should have spoken to it;
there was money hid, or a murder committed;
and give me leave to observe that murder is a matter
cognizable by law, and this came regularly into
judgment before you." "Well, my Lord, you will
have your way; but, in short, I did speak to it."
"And what answer, Mr. Justice, I pray you&mdash;what
answer did it make you?" "My Lord, the
answer was, not without a thump with the staff,
and a shake of the lanthorn, that he was the watch-man
of the night, and came to give me notice, that
he had found the street-door open, and that, unless
I arose and shut it, I might chance to be robbed
before break of day."</p>

<p>The moment these words were out of the good
Justice's mouth, the Bishop vanished with much
more haste than did the supposed ghost, and in as
great a surprise at the Justice's scepticism, as the
Justice was at the Bishop's credulity.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
GHOSTLY ADVENTURER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> thirty years ago, some labouring mechanics
met one Saturday evening, after receiving their
wages, at a public-house, near Rippon, in Yorkshire,
for the purpose of enjoying themselves convivially,
after the cares and fatigues of the week.
The glass circulated freely: every man told his
story, or sung a song; and various were the subjects
of conversation. At length that of courage
was introduced; every man now considered himself
a hero, as is generally the case when liquor
begins to operate. One boasted his skill as a pugilist,
and related how many battles he had fought,
and came off victorious; another related a dreadful
encounter he had lately had with a mad dog, whom
he overpowered and left dead on the field; a third
told a story of his sleeping in a haunted house, and
his conversation with a dreadful ghost. In short,
various and extravagant were the different tales
they told; until one, who had hitherto remained
silent, arose, and told them that, notwithstanding
their boasted courage, he would wager a bet of
five guineas, that not one of the company had resolution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>sufficient to go to the bone-house, in the
parish church-yard (which was about a mile distant),
and bring a skull from thence with him, and
place it on the table before the guests. This
wager was soon accepted by one of the party, who
immediately set off on his expedition to the church-yard.
The wag who had proposed the bet, and
who knew a nearer by-way to the bone-house than
his opponent had taken, requested of the landlady
to lend him a white sheet, and that he would soon
cool this heroic man's courage. The landlady,
who enjoyed the joke, complied with his request,
lent him the sheet, and off set our wag with the
utmost speed. He arrived at the bone-house first,
threw the sheet over him, and placed himself in
one corner, waiting the arrival of his comrade.
Presently after enters the first man, with slow deliberate
pace; and observing a figure in white, he
felt himself greatly alarmed (as he afterwards acknowledged).
However, he resumed his courage,
advanced, stooped down, and picked up a skull.
Immediately the phantom exclaimed, in a deep and
hollow tone, "<i>That's my father's skull!</i>" "Well
then," replied the adventurer, "if it be thy father's
skull, take it." So down he laid it, and took
up another; when the figure replied, in the same
hollow tone, "<i>That's my mother's skull!</i>" "Well
then," the other again replied, "if it be thy mother's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>skull, take it." So down he laid it, and took
up a third. The apparition now, in a tremendously
awful manner, cried out, "<i>That's my skull!</i>"
"If it be the devil's skull, I'll have it!" answered
the hero; and off he ran with it in his hand,
greatly terrified, and the spectre after him.</p>

<p>In his flight through the church-yard, he stumbled
over a tomb-stone, and fell; which occasioned
the ghost likewise to fall upon him, which increased
not a little his fright. However, he soon
extricated himself, and again bent his flight towards
the inn, which he soon reached; and, bolting suddenly
into the room, exclaimed, with terrific countenance,
his hair standing on end, "Here is the
skull you sent me for: but, by George, the right
owner's coming for it!" Saying which, down went
the skull, and instantly appeared the figure with
the white sheet on. This unexpected intrusion so
much frightened all the company, that they ran
out of the house as fast as possible, really believing
it was an apparition from the tombs come to
punish them for their sacrilegious theft. Such
power has fear over the strongest mind when taken
by surprise! The undaunted adventurer, however,
won his wager; which was spent at the same house
the Saturday following, when the joke was universally
allowed to be a very good one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
HEROIC MIDSHIPMAN;<br />
<span class="xsm">OR</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>CHURCH-YARD ENCOUNTER</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a respectable inn, in a market-town, in the
west of England, some few years since, a regular
set of the inhabitants met every evening to smoke
their pipes, and pass a convivial hour. The conversation,
as is usual at those places, was generally
desultory. One evening, the subject introduced
was concerning ghosts and apparitions; and many
were the dreadful stories then told. A young midshipman,
having accidentally dropped in, sat a
silent and an attentive hearer; and, among other
tales, heard a dreadful one of a sprite or hobgoblin
dressed in white, which every night was seen hovering
over the graves, in a church-yard at no great
distance from the inn, and through which was a
foot-path to one of the principal streets in the town.
Our young gentleman felt himself stimulated with
an ardour of quixotism at this relation; and was
determined in his own mind, whatever might be
the consequence, to encounter this nightly spectre,
which so much disturbed the courageous inhabitants
of the place. His pride was, to perform this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mighty achievement alone. Therefore, between
eleven and twelve o'clock at night, out he sallies,
without making his intentions known to any one,
and entered the church-yard. But, I should observe,
that he had his hanger by his side. Having
reached about the middle of the church-yard, he
observed, sure enough, something in white moving
backwards and forwards; but the haziness of the
night prevented his strict discernment of the figure's
shape. As it appeared advancing towards him, a
momentary trepidation seized him. He retreated
a few steps; but, soon recovering himself, he resolutely
cried out, "<i>Who comes here?</i>" No answer
being made, he again cried out, "<i>Who comes here?</i>"
Still no reply was made. He then groped about
for a stone or brick-bat, which having found, he
threw with great violence at the figure; upon
which it appeared to move much quicker than before.
He again spoke to the figure; and, receiving
no answer, drew his hanger, and made a desperate
stroke at this dreadful spectre, which moving
with still greater agility, now alarmed our adventurer,
and caused him to run away greatly terrified,
believing he had encountered some supernatural
appearance, which had resisted all his blows. It
was not long ere he reached home, and went to
bed; but his fright was so great, that sleep could
not gain any ascendancy over him. He therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
lay ruminating on this extraordinary affair the
whole night. In the morning, while at breakfast,
the bellman, or crier, came nearly under his window,
and began his usual introductory address of
"<i>O-yez! O-yez!</i>" These words immediately arrested
the ears of our adventurer; and, to his very
great astonishment, he heard him thus proceed&mdash;"This
is to give notice, that whereas some evil-disposed
person, or persons, did wantonly cut and
maim the parson's white mare, which was grazing
in the church-yard last night, a reward of ten guineas
will be given to any person who will discover
the offender, or offenders, so that they may be
brought to justice! <i>God save the King!</i>" Our
champion now thought it prudent to decamp without
beat of drum. Thus ended this ghostly adventure;
the particulars of which the inhabitants
were informed of by letter, the moment the young
gentleman had got safe on board his ship.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
COCK-LANE GHOST.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the middle of January 1762, a gentleman
was sent for to the house of one Parsons, the officiating
parish clerk of St. Sepulchre's, in Cock
Lane, near West Smithfield, to be witness to the
noises, and other extraordinary circumstances, attending
the supposed presence of a spirit, that, for
two years preceding, had been heard in the night,
to the great terror of the family. This knocking
and scratching was always heard under the bed
where the children lay; the eldest was about
twelve years of age. To find out the cause, Mr.
Parsons, the parish-clerk, ordered the wainscot to
be taken down; which was accordingly done:
but the noise, instead of ceasing, as he hoped, became
more violent than ever. The children were
afterwards removed into the two-pair of stairs
room, where the same noise followed, and was frequently
heard all night.</p>

<p>From these circumstances it was apprehended
that the house was haunted; and the other child declared,
that she, some time ago, had seen the apparition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>of a woman, surrounded, as it were, with a
blazing light. About two years prior to which, a
publican in the neighbourhood, bringing a pot of
beer into the house, about eleven o'clock at night,
was so frightened that he let the beer fall, upon
seeing on the stairs, as he was looking up, a bright
shining figure of a woman, by which he saw
through a window into the charity-school, and
saw the dial in the school. The figure passed by
him, and beckoned him to follow; but he was too
much terrified to obey its directions: he ran home,
and was very sick. Soon after, Mr. Parsons himself,
having occasion to go into another room, saw
the same appearance. Both these happened
within the space of an hour.</p>

<p>To throw some light upon this very mysterious
affair, we shall begin with the narrative of
Mr. Brown, of Amen Corner, published January
23d, 1762; the substance of which is as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>That in 1759, one Mr. K&mdash;&mdash; employed an agent
to carry a letter to a young gentlewoman of a reputable
family in Norfolk, and to bring her up to
London in a post-chaise, if she would be willing
to come. That she did come; but Mr. K&mdash;&mdash;
being at Greenwich, she followed him there directly,
and was received by him, after a journey
of one hundred miles performed in one day, with
much tenderness. After some short stay at Greenwich,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>where it was thought necessary that she
should make a will in his favour, she was removed
to a lodging near the Mansion-House; from thence
to lodgings, behind St. Sepulchre's church; and,
lastly, to a house in Bartlett Court, in the parish
of Clerkenwell. Here, in 1760, she was taken ill
of the small-pox; and, on or about the 31st of
January, her sister, who lived reputably in Pall-Mall,
was first made acquainted with her illness,
and place of residence. Being greatly concerned
thus to hear of her, she went immediately, and
found her in a fair way of doing well; next day she
sent, and received a favourable account of her;
but, on the morning following, word was brought
that her sister was dead. She died February 2d,
1760; and was buried, in two or three days after,
at the church of St. John, Clerkenwell. Her sister,
attending her funeral, was surprised at not
seeing a plate upon the coffin, and expressed that
surprise to Mr. Brown after the funeral was over;
lamenting, at the same time, she had not been permitted
to see her sister's corpse, the coffin being
screwed down before she came. She added, that
K&mdash;&mdash; had married one of her sisters, and had
ruined the other, who was buried by the name of &mdash;&mdash;,
as appears by the parish register. By the
will already mentioned, K&mdash;&mdash; availed himself of
her fortune, to the prejudice of her brother and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
sisters, who all lived in perfect harmony until this
unhappy affair happened.</p>

<p>Such is the account given by Mr. Brown, of
Amen Corner. A worthy clergyman, however,
who attended her several times, and who administered
to her the last comforts of his function,
declares, that the small-pox with which she was
seized, was of the confluent sort; and that the
gentleman of the faculty, who attended her, had
pronounced her irrecoverable some days before
her death.</p>

<p>It was, however, the ghost of this person, that
Parsons declared had taken possession of his girl,
a child about twelve years old, who lay with the
deceased in the absence of her supposed husband,
when he was in the country at a wedding; and
then it was, that the knocking was first heard, to
the great terror of this child, she frequently crying
out that she might not be taken away. Soon after,
this woman died, whose apparition was now supposed
to appear to this same child; and, in answer
to the question put to her, What was the occasion
of the first knocking, &amp;c. before she died? answered,
that it was the spirit of her sister, the first
wife of Mr. K&mdash;&mdash;, who was husband to them
both.</p>

<p>Having now sufficiently prepared the reader,
we shall proceed in our narrative. The gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
already said to have been sent for, attended, and
found the child in bed; and, the spirit being at
hand, several questions were put to it by the father,
which, to avoid repetition, we shall relate
hereafter. The gentleman not caring to pronounce
too hastily upon what appeared to him extraordinary,
got some friends together, among whom were
two or three clergymen, about twenty other
persons, and two negroes, who sat up another
night.</p>

<p>They first thoroughly examined the bed, bed-clothes,
&amp;c.; and, being satisfied that there was
no visible appearance of deceit, the child with its
sister was put into bed, which was found to shake
extremely by the gentleman who had placed himself
at the foot of it. Among others, the following
questions were asked&mdash;</p>

<p>Whether her disturbance was occasioned by any
ill-treatment from Mr. K&mdash;&mdash;?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Whether she was brought to an untimely end
by poison?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>In what was the poison administered, beer or
purl?&mdash;Purl.</p>

<p>How long before her death?&mdash;Three hours.</p>

<p>Is the person called Carrots, able to give information
about the poison?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Whether she was K&mdash;&mdash;'s wife's sister?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p><p>Whether she was married to K&mdash;&mdash;?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Whether any other person than K&mdash;&mdash; was
concerned in the poisoning?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Whether she could visibly appear to any one?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Whether she would do so?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Whether she could go out of that house?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Whether she would follow the child everywhere?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Whether she was pleased at being asked questions?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Whether it eased her mind?&mdash;Yes. (Here a
mysterious noise, compared to the fluttering of
wings round the room, was heard.)</p>

<p>How long before her death had she told Carrots
(her servant) that she was poisoned?&mdash;One hour.
(Here Carrots, who was admitted to be one of the
company on Tuesday night, asserted that the deceased
had not told her so, she being at that time
speechless.)</p>

<p>How long did Carrots live with her?&mdash;Three or
four days. (Carrots attested the truth of this.)</p>

<p>Whether, if the accused should be taken up, he
would confess?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Whether she should be at ease in her mind, if
the man was hanged?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>How long it would be before he would be executed?&mdash;Three
years.</p>

<p>How many clergymen were in the room?&mdash;Three.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p><p>How many negroes?&mdash;Two.</p>

<p>Whether she could distinguish the person of any
one in the room?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Whether the colour of a watch held up by one of
the clergymen was white, yellow, blue, or black?&mdash;Black.
(The watch was in a black shagreen case.)</p>

<p>At what time she would depart in the morning?&mdash;At
four o'clock.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at this hour the noise removed to
the Wheat-sheaf, a public-house at the distance of
a few doors, in the bed-chamber of the landlord
and landlady, to the great affright and terror of
them both. Such was the manner of interrogating
the spirit: the answer was given by knocking or
scratching. An affirmative was one knock; a
negative, two. Displeasure was expressed by
scratching.</p>

<p>Nothing more occurred till the following morning,
when the knocking began about seven o'clock.
But, notwithstanding some extraordinary answers
to the several questions proposed, it was still a
matter of doubt whether the whole was not a piece
of imposition; and it was resolved to remove the
child elsewhere. Accordingly, instead of its being
carried home, it was conveyed to a house in Crown-and-Cushion
Court, at the upper end of Cow Lane,
near Smithfield, where two clergymen, several gentlemen,
and some ladies, assembled in the evening.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p><p>About eleven o'clock the knocking began; when
a gentleman in the room, speaking angrily to the
girl, and hinting that he suspected it was some
trick of her's, the child was uneasy, and cried:
on which the knocking was heard louder, and much
faster than before; but no answer could be obtained
to any question while that gentleman staid
in the room.</p>

<p>After he was gone, the noise ceased: and nothing
was heard till a little after twelve o'clock,
when the child was seized with a trembling and
shivering; in which manner she had always been
affected, on the departure as well as the approach
of the ghost. Upon this, one of the company
asked, whether it would return again, and at what
time? Answer was made in the usual manner by
knocks, that it would return again before seven in
the morning; and then a noise, like the fluttering
of wings, was heard; after which all was quiet till
between six and seven on Friday morning, when
the knocking began again.</p>

<p>A little before seven, two clergymen came, when
the fluttering noise was repeated, which in this
strange affair was considered as a mark of the spirit's
being pleased. Then several questions, particularly
one, by a gentlewoman who was an acquaintance
of the deceased, who came out of mere
curiosity, and had been to see her some time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
before she died: the question was, How many days
it was before her death, that this gentlewoman
came to see her? The answer given was three
knocks, signifying three days; which was exactly
right. Another question was, Whether some of
the then company had not a relation that had
been buried in the same vault where she lay? To
which it replied by one knock, Yes. They asked,
severally, if it was their relation? To all of which,
except the last, she answered by two knocks,
meaning No; but to the last person she gave one
knock, which was right. These two circumstances
greatly alarmed all the company.</p>

<p>Near twenty persons sat up in the room: but it
was not till about six o'clock in the morning that
the first alarm was given, which coming spontaneously,
as well as suddenly, a good deal struck the
imagination of the auditors. The scratches were
compared to that of a cat upon a cane chair. The
child now appeared to be in a sound sleep, and
nothing further could be obtained. It had been
observed, in conversation, by a person who expressed
himself pretty warmly on the subject, that
the whole was an imposture, and more to the same
purpose; which gave rise to some sharp altercation
among the company&mdash;some believing, and others
disbelieving the reality of the apparition. This dispute
was no sooner begun, than the spirit was gone;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and no more knocking and scratching was to be
heard.</p>

<p>About seven o'clock the girl seemed to awake
in a violent fit of crying and tears. Upon being
asked the occasion, and assured that nothing of
harm should happen to her, she declared that her
tears were the effect of her imagination at what
would become of her daddy, who must needs be
ruined and undone, if this matter should be supposed
to be an imposture. She was told, that the
company had looked upon her as in a sound sleep
when the above dispute happened. To which she
replied, "Aye, but not so sound but that I could
hear all you said."</p>

<p>On the Sunday night following, the girl lay at a
house opposite the school-house in Cock Lane; at
which place a person of distinction, two clergymen,
and several other persons, were present. Between
ten and eleven o'clock the knocking began: the
principal questions and answers were the same as
those already mentioned; but among some new
ones of little consequence, was the following?&mdash;Will
you attend the girl at any place whither she
may be appointed to be carried, by authority?
Answered in the affirmative. At eleven o'clock,
eleven distinct knocks were heard; and at twelve,
when being asked if it was going away, and when
it would return again, seven knocks were given.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Accordingly, when St. Sepulchre's clock struck
seven, on Monday morning, this invisible agent
knocked the same number of times. Some few
questions were asked at this meeting, much to the
same purport as those above inserted, and answered
in the same manner. Every person was put out
of the room, who could be supposed to have the
least connexion with the girl: her hands were
laid over the bed-clothes, and the bed narrowly
looked under, &amp;c. but no discovery was made.</p>

<p>On the night of the 1st of February, many gentlemen,
eminent for their rank and character, were,
by the invitation of the Reverend Mr. Aldrich, of
Clerkenwell, assembled at his house, for the examination
of the noises supposed to be made by a
departed spirit for the detection of some enormous
crime.</p>

<p>About ten at night, the gentlemen met in the
chamber, in which the girl supposed to be disturbed
by a spirit had, with proper caution, been
put to bed by several ladies. They sat with her
rather more than an hour; and, hearing nothing,
went down stairs, when they interrogated the father
of the girl, who denied, in the strongest terms, any
knowledge or belief of fraud.</p>

<p>The supposed spirit had before publicly promised,
by an affirmative knock, that it would attend
one of the gentlemen into the vault under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
church of St. John, Clerkenwell, where the body
was deposited; and give a token of her presence
there, by a knock upon her coffin: it was, therefore,
determined to make this trial of the existence
or veracity of the supposed spirit.</p>

<p>While they were inquiring and deliberating,
they were summoned into the girl's chamber by
the ladies who remained near her bed, and who
heard knocks and scratches. When the gentlemen
entered, the girl declared that she felt the
spirit like a mouse upon her back, and was required
to hold her hands out of bed. From that time,
though the spirit was very solemnly required to
manifest its existence, by appearance, by impression
on the hand or body of any person present,
by scratches, knocks, or any other agency, no
evidence of any preternatural power was exhibited.</p>

<p>The spirit was then very seriously advertised,
that the person to whom the promise was made, of
striking the coffin, was then about to visit the
vault, and that the performance of the promise
was then claimed. The company, at one o'clock,
went into the church; and that gentleman, to
whom the promise was made, went, with one
more, into the vault. The spirit was very solemnly
required to perform its promise, but nothing more
than silence ensued: the person supposed to be
accused by the spirit then went down, with several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
others, but no effect was perceived. Upon their
return, they examined the girl, but could draw no
confession from her. Between two and three,
she desired, and was permitted, to go home with
her father.</p>

<p>No doubt now remained of the fallacy of this
spirit. It was supposed that the girl was practised
in the art of ventriloquism, an art better known
now than formerly; but it was soon after discovered
that there was not so much ingenuity in the
fraud.</p>

<p>A bed was slung like a hammock, in the middle
of a room, at a gentleman's house, where
the girl was sent. The servants were ordered to
watch her narrowly; and, about a quarter of an
hour before bed-time, she was observed to conceal
something under her clothes. Information of this
being given to the gentlemen attending, they were
of opinion, that a connivance at the beginning of
the scene would be the most likely means of leading
them to a full discovery of the fact. In the
morning, about six o'clock, the knockings came,
and answered to questions as usual, but in so
different a sound, that it was very apparent this
method of operating was a fresh contrivance.
When the knockings, which continued for near
half an hour, were over, she was several times
asked, if she had any wood or other thing in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
bed, against which she could strike? which she
obstinately denied. Two maid-servants being then
ordered to take her out of bed, a piece of board
was found in it, which, as was observed, she had
conveyed there the night before.</p>

<p>Soon after, a trial came on before Lord Mansfield,
in the Court of King's Bench, Guildhall, by
a special jury, on an indictment against Richard
Parsons, and Elizabeth his wife, Mary Fraser, a
clergyman, and a reputable tradesman, for a conspiracy
in the Cock-Lane ghost affair, to injure
the character, &amp;c. of Mr. William Kent; when
they were all found guilty. The trial lasted
about twelve hours.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
HYPOCHONDRIAC GENTLEMAN<br />
<span class="xsm">AND</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>THE JACK-ASS</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A sober</span> gentleman of very great respectability,
who was low-spirited and hypochondriac to a
degree, was at times so fanciful, that almost every
rustling noise he heard was taken for an apparition
or hobgoblin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p><p>It happened that he was abroad at a friend's
house later than ordinary one night; but, it
being moon-light, and having a servant with him,
he seemed to be easy, and was observed to be
cheerful, and even merry, with a great deal more
of good-humour than had been observed in him
for some time before.</p>

<p>He knew his way perfectly well, for it was
within three miles of the town where he lived, and
he was very well mounted: but, though the moon
was up, an accident, which a little disordered him,
was, that a very thick black cloud appeared to
him to come suddenly over his head, which made
it very dark; and, to add to his discomfort, it
began to rain violently.</p>

<p>Upon this he resolved to ride for it, having not
above two miles to the town; so, clapping spurs
to his horse, he galloped away. His man (whose
name was Jervais), not being so well mounted, was
a considerable way behind. The darkness of the
night, and the rain together, put him a little out
of humour, and made him ride rather harder than
his usual pace.</p>

<p>In his way home, there was a small river for him
to pass; but there was a good bridge over it, well
walled on both sides, so that there was no more
danger than in any other place. The gentleman
kept on at a good pace, and was rather more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
half over the bridge, when his horse stopped all
on a sudden, and would not go on. He saw nothing
at first, and was therefore not much discomposed
at it, but spurred his horse to go forward.
The horse then went two or three steps; then
stopped again, snorted, and started; then attempted
to turn short back. The gentleman, in
endeavouring to see what frightened the horse,
saw two broad staring eyes looking him full in the
face.</p>

<p>He was now most heartily frightened; but, by
this time, he heard his man Jervais coming up.
When he came near, the first thing he heard his
master say, was, "Bless me, it is the devil!" at
which exclamation the man was almost as much
frightened as his master. However, the gentleman,
a little encouraged to hear his man so near him,
pressed his horse once more to go forward, and
called aloud to his servant to follow; but Jervais,
being much frightened, made no haste. At length,
with great difficulty, he got over the bridge, and
passed by the creature with the broad staring
eyes, which he positively affirmed was the devil.</p>

<p>Though Jervais was near enough, yet fearing
his master would order him to go before, he kept
as far off as he possibly could. When his master
called, he answered, but proceeded very slowly,
till he observed his master had gone past; when,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
being obliged to follow, he went on very softly
till he came to the bridge, where he plainly saw
what it was his master's horse snorted at, which
the reader will be made acquainted with presently.</p>

<p>The gentleman, having now past the difficulty,
galloped home as fast as possible, and got into the
house long before Jervais could get up with him.
As soon as he alighted, he swooned away, such an
effect the fright had on him; and with much
difficulty they brought him to himself. When he
recovered, he told the family a formal story, that
at such a bridge he met with the devil, who was
standing at the left-hand corner of the wall, and
stared him full in the face; and he so fully expatiated
on this subject, that all believed, at least,
he had met with an apparition.</p>

<p>Jervais soon after came home, and went directly
to the stable to take care of the horses; where he
told <i>his story</i> in the following manner to his fellow-servants:
"Finding," says he, "that my master was
in danger of being thrown over the bridge, I fearlessly
rode near him; when, to my very great surprise,
I found that my master's horse (which was
young and skittish) was frightened at an ass, which
stood grazing near the corner of the wall." "Are
you sure it was an ass, Jervais?" asked the servants,
staring one at another, half frightened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
themselves. "Are you quite sure of it?" "Yes,"
replied the man; "for, as soon as my master had
got by, I rode up to it; and, on discovering the
cause of our fear, I thrashed it with my stick, on
which it fell a braying; and I rode home after my
master." "Why, Jervais," said the servants, "your
master believes it was the devil." "I am sorry,"
said the man, "my master should have been so
much deceived; but, really, it was nothing more
nor less than an ass."</p>

<p>The story now got vent; and the first part of it
flew all over the town, that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (mentioning
his name) had seen the devil, and was almost
frightened to death.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the man's tale was circulated, that
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s strange and wonderful apparition of
the devil was nothing more than an ass; which
raised the laugh sufficiently against the master.</p>

<p>However, poor Jervais lost his place for gossiping;
and his master insists upon it to this day, that
it was the devil, and that he knew him by his
broad eyes and cloven feet. Such is the power of
imagination over the weak and credulous!</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
CASTLE APPARITION.</h2>

<p class="chapsub"><i>Translated by the Rev. Weeden Butler, Jun. from
a Monkish Manuscript.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the vicinity of Chamberry, a town in Savoy,
stood the ancient mansion of the Albertini: round
it were several little buildings, in which were deposited
the cattle, poultry, &amp;c. &amp;c. belonging to
the family. A young gentleman, by name Barbarosse,
came to the chateau on a visit for a few
days; he was cordially received, being of a pleasing
lively disposition; and an elegant room in the east
wing was prepared for his accommodation.</p>

<p>The family, and their young guests, spent the
day very agreeably; and, after supper, they sat
round a comfortable large fire, and diverted themselves
with songs and stories: the former, as is
generally the case, were some of the sprightly,
some of the tender and pathetic kind; but the latter
were, for the most part, of the melancholy cast,
particularly those which related to preternatural
occurrences. The social party separated at half
past twelve o'clock; and Barbarosse retired to his
chamber. It was a handsome room on the first
floor, having three doors; two of these belonged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to two little closets, one on the right that overlooked
a farm-yard, and another more to the left
that presented a view through the window of a
large romantic wood; the third door was that by
which he entered his room, after traversing a long
passage. Our youth had visited this room in the
morning, and looked out of the window to enjoy
the prospect for a great while.</p>

<p>As he entered this apartment, with his mind
full of the diversion just left, he set his candle
down upon the table, and looked about him.
There was an excellent fire in the chimney, with
an iron grating before it, to prevent accidents; a
large elbow-chair stood near it; and, not being at
all sleepy, he sat down reflecting on the amusements
of the day, and endeavoured to remember
the tales he had heard. In some he thought he
perceived strong traits of truth; and in others he
discovered palpable fiction and absurdity. Whilst
he was deliberating on the various incidents, the
heavy watch-bell tolled two; but Barbarosse did
not attend to it, being deeply engaged in his contemplations.
He was suddenly awakened from his
reveries by an uncommon rustling sound issuing
from the closet on the right hand; and, listening
attentively, he heard distinct taps upon the floor
at short intervals.</p>

<p>Alarmed at the circumstance, he walked slowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to his bed-side, and drew forth his pocket-pistols
from under the pillow; these he carefully placed
upon the table, and resumed the elbow-chair. All
was again still as death; and nought but the
winds, which whistled round the watch-tower and
the adjacent buildings, could be heard.</p>

<p>Barbarosse looked towards the door of the closet,
which he then, and not till then, perceived was not
shut, but found that it hung upon the jar; immediately
a furious blast forced it wide open; the
taper burnt blue, and the fire seemed almost
extinct.</p>

<p>Barbarosse arose, put forth a silent hasty ejaculation
of prayer, and sat down again; again he
heard the noise! He started up, seized the pistols,
and stood motionless; whilst large cold drops of
dew hung upon his face. Still his heart continued
firm, and he grew more composed, when the rustling
taps were renewed! Barbarosse desperately
invoked the protection of Heaven, cocked one
of the pistols, and was about to rush into the
portentous apartment, when the noise increased
and drew nearer: a loud peal of thunder, that
seemed to rend the firmament, shook violently the
solid battlements of the watch-tower; the deep-toned
bell tolled three, and its hollow sound long
vibrated on the ear of Barbarosse with fainter and
fainter murmurs; when a tremendous cry thrilled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
him with terror and dismay; and, lo! the long-dreaded
spectre stalked into the middle of the
room: and Barbarosse, overcome with surprise
and astonishment at the <i>unexpected</i> apparition,
sunk down <i>convulsed</i><a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> in his chair.</p>

<p>The phantom was armed <i>de cap en pied</i>, and
clad in a black garment. On his crest a black
plume waved majestically; and, instead of a glove
or any other sort of lady's favour, he wore a blood-red
token. He bore no weapon of offence in his
hand; but a gloomy shield, made of the feathers of
some kind of bird, was cast over each shoulder.
He was booted and spurred; and, looking upon
Barbarosse with ardent eyes, raised his feathery
arms, and struck them vehemently against his
sides, making at the same time the most vociferous
noise!</p>

<p>Then it was, that Barbarosse found he had
not shut down the window in the morning; from
which neglect it happened, that a <i>black game-cock</i>
had flown into the closet, and created all this inexpressible
confusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.</span> Samuel Foote, the celebrated comedian,
played the following trick upon Doctor Gower,
who was then provost of his college, a man of
considerable learning, but rather of a grave pedantic
turn of mind.</p>

<p>The church belonging to the college fronted the
side of a lane, where cattle were sometimes turned
out to graze during the night; and from the steeple
hung the bell-rope, very low in the middle of the
outside porch. Foote saw in this an object likely
to produce some fun, and immediately set about
to accomplish his purpose. He accordingly, one
night, slily tied a wisp of hay to the rope, as a bait
for the cows in their peregrination to the grazing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ground. The scheme succeeded to his wish. One
of the cows soon after, smelling the hay as she
passed by the church-door, instantly seized on it,
and, by tugging at the rope, made the bell ring,
to the astonishment of the sexton and the whole
parish.</p>

<p>This happened several nights successively; and
the incident gave rise to various reports&mdash;such as,
not only that the church was haunted by evil spirits,
but that several spectres were seen walking about
the church-yard, in all those hideous and frightful
shapes, which fear, ignorance, and fancy, usually
suggest on such occasions.</p>

<p>An event of this kind, however, was to be explored,
for the honour of philosophy, as well as
for the quiet of the parish. Accordingly, the
Doctor and the sexton agreed to sit up one night,
and, on the first alarm, to run out, and drag the
culprit to condign punishment. Their plan being
arranged, they waited with the utmost impatience
for the appointed signal: at last, the bell began
to sound its usual alarm, and they both sallied out
in the dark, determined on making a discovery.</p>

<p>The sexton was the first in the attack: he seized
the cow by the tail, and cried out it was a gentleman
commoner, as he had him by the tail of his
gown; while the Doctor, who had caught the cow
by the horns at the same time, immediately replied,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
"No, no, you blockhead, 'tis the postman; and
here I have hold of the rascal by his blowing-horn."
Lights however were immediately brought,
when the character of the real offender was discovered,
and the laugh of the whole town was turned
upon the Doctor.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
HAUNTED CASTLE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> castle of Ardivillers, near Breteuil, was reported
to be haunted by evil spirits. Dreadful
noises were heard; and flames were seen, by night,
to issue from various apertures. The farmer who
was entrusted with the care of the house, in the
absence of its owner, the President d'Ardivillers,
could alone live there. The spirit seemed to
respect him; but any person who ventured to
take up a night's lodging in the castle was sure to
bear the marks of his audacity.</p>

<p>Superstition is catching. The peasants in the
neighbourhood at length began to see strange
sights. Sometimes a dozen of ghosts would appear
in the air above the castle dancing. At other
times, a number of presidents and counsellors, in
red robes, appeared in the adjacent meadow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
There they sat in judgment on a gentleman of the
country, who had been beheaded for some crime
an hundred years before. In short, many had
seen, and all had heard, the wonders of the castle
of Ardivillers.</p>

<p>This affair had continued four or five years, to
the great loss of the President, who had been
obliged to let the estate to the farmer at a very
low rent. At length, suspecting some artifice, he
resolved to visit and inspect the castle himself.</p>

<p>Taking with him two gentlemen, his friends, they
determined to pass the night in the same apartment;
and if any noise or apparition disturbed
them, to discharge their pistols at either ghost or
sound. As spirits know all things, they were probably
aware of these preparations, and not one
appeared. But, in the chamber just above, a
dreadful rattling of chains was heard; and the wife
and children of the farmer ran to assist their lord.
They threw themselves on their knees, begging
that he would not visit that terrible room. "My
lord," said they, "what can human force effect
against people of t'other world? Monsieur de
Ficancout attempted the same enterprise years
ago, and he returned with a dislocated arm. M.
D'Urselles tried too; he was overwhelmed with
bundles of hay, and was ill for a long time after."
In short, so many attempts were mentioned, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the President's friends advised <i>him</i> to abandon the
design.</p>

<p>But still <i>they</i> determined to encounter the
danger. Proceeding up stairs to an extensive
room, each having a candle in one hand, and a
pistol in the other, they found it full of thick
smoke, which increased more and more from some
flames that were visible. Soon after, the ghost or
spirit faintly appeared in the middle: he seemed
quite black, and was amusing himself with cutting
capers; but another eruption of flame and smoke
hid him from their view. He had horns and a long
tail; and was, in truth, a dreadful object.</p>

<p>One of the gentlemen found his courage rather
fail. "This is certainly supernatural," said he;
"let us retire." The other, endued with more
boldness, asserted that the smoke was that of gunpowder,
which is no supernatural composition;
"and if this same spirit," added he, "knew his
own nature and trade, he should have extinguished
our candles."</p>

<p>With these words, he jumped amidst the smoke
and flames, and pursued the spectre. He soon discharged
the pistol at his back, and hit him exactly
in the middle; but was himself seized with fear,
when the spirit, far from falling, turned round and
rushed upon him. Soon recovering himself, he
resolved to grasp the ghost, to discover if it were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
indeed aërial and impassable. Mr. Spectre, disordered
by this new manœuvre, rushed to the
tower, and descended a small staircase.</p>

<p>The gentleman ran after, and, never losing
sight of him, passed several courts and gardens,
still turning as the spirit winded, till at length they
entered into an open barn. Here the pursuer,
certain, as he thought, of his prey, shut the door,
but when he turned round, what was his amazement,
to see the spirit totally disappear.</p>

<p>In great confusion, he called to the servants for
more lights. On examining the spot of the spirit's
disappearance, he found a trap-door; upon raising
which, several mattresses appeared, to break the
fall of any headlong adventurer. Therefore, descending,
he found the spirit to be no other than
the <i>farmer</i> himself. His dress, of a complete
bull's hide, had secured him from the pistol-shot;
and the horns and tail were not diabolic, but mere
natural appendages of the original. The rogue
confessed his tricks, and was pardoned, on paying
the arrears due for five years, at the old rent of
the land.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
HAMMERSMITH GHOST.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1804, the inhabitants of Hammersmith
were much alarmed by a nocturnal appearance;
which, for a considerable time, eluded detection
or discovery. In the course of this unfortunate
affair, two innocent persons met with an untimely
death; and as this transaction engaged the attention
of the public in a high degree, we shall fully
relate the particulars of it.</p>

<p>An unknown person made it his diversion to
alarm the inhabitants, in January 1804, by assuming
the figure of a spectre. This sham ghost has certainly
much to answer for. One poor woman,
who was far advanced in her pregnancy of a second
child, was so much shocked, that she took
to her bed, and survived only two days. She had
been crossing near the church-yard about ten
o'clock at night, when she beheld something, as
she described, rise from the tomb-stones. The
figure was very tall, and very white! She attempted
to run, but the supposed ghost soon overtook
her, and, pressing her in his arms, she fainted;
in which situation she remained some hours, till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
discovered by the neighbours, who kindly led her
home, when she took to her bed, from which, alas!
she never rose. A waggoner belonging to Mr.
Russell was also so alarmed, while driving a team
of eight horses, which had sixteen passengers at
the time, that he took to his heels, and left the
waggon, horses, and passengers, in the greatest
danger. Neither man, woman, or child, would
pass that way for some time; and the report was,
that it was the apparition of a man who had cut his
throat in that neighbourhood above a year before.
Several lay in wait different nights for the ghost;
but there were so many bye-lanes, and paths leading
to Hammersmith, that he was always sure of
being in that which was unguarded, and every
night played off his tricks, to the terror of the
passengers.</p>

<p>One Francis Smith, doubtless incensed at the
unknown person who was in the habit of assuming
the supernatural character, and thus frightening
the superstitious inhabitants of the village, rashly
determined on watching for, and shooting the
ghost; when, unfortunately, in Black-Lion Lane, he
shot a poor innocent man, Thomas Millwood, a
bricklayer, who was in a white dress, the usual
habiliment of his occupation. This rash act, having
been judged wilful murder by the coroner's
inquest, Smith was accordingly committed to gaol,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and took his trial at the ensuing sessions at the
Old Bailey, January 13th, 1804. The jury at first
found him guilty of manslaughter; but the crime
being deemed murder in the eye of the law, the
judge could only receive a verdict of Guilty, or
acquittal. He was then found guilty, and received
sentence of death, but was afterwards pardoned
on condition of being imprisoned one year.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
FRIGHTENED CARRIER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> October 1813, a little before midnight, as one
of the carriers between Nottingham and Loughborough,
was passing near the village of Rempstone,
he was extremely surprised at meeting what
he thought was a funeral procession, marching in a
most solemn and steady order in the centre of the
road. The carrier, with a becoming propriety and
decorum, drew his cart to the side of the road,
that the mournful cavalcade might pass without
any interruption. Very active inquiry was immediately
afterwards made in the neighbourhood, but
not the least knowledge could be obtained as to
where this solemn group had come from, or whither
it was going; it was therefore concluded, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
some ghostly apparition or other had thought proper
to be then exercising its nocturnal avocation.
Some days afterwards it was found out, that a person,
who lived in the neighbouring village, had
been endeavouring to construct a carriage upon
such a principle as to go without horses; and,
wishing to make his experiment as secret as possible,
had chosen that dead hour of the night,
for trying his apparatus on the turnpike road; but
unluckily meeting with the carrier, he became
alarmed for fear of an exposure, and therefore
threw a large sheet over the machinery, and
passed the cart as silently as possible, to avoid
being detected.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
CLUB-ROOM GHOST.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a town in the west of England, was held a
club of twenty-four persons, which assembled once
a week, to drink punch, smoke tobacco, and talk
politics. Like Rubens's Academy at Antwerp, each
member had his peculiar chair, and the president's
was more exalted than the rest. One of the members
had been in a dying state for some time;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of course, his chair, while he was absent, remained
vacant.</p>

<p>The club being met on their usual night, inquiries
were naturally made after their associate. As
he lived in the adjoining house, a particular friend
went himself to inquire for him, and returned with
the dismal tidings, that he could not possibly survive
the night. This threw a gloom on the company,
and all efforts to turn the conversation from
the sad subject before them were ineffectual.</p>

<p>About midnight (the time, by long prescription,
appropriated for the walking of spectres), the door
opened; and the form, in white, of the dying, or
rather of the dead man, walked into the room,
and took his seat in the accustomed chair: there
he remained in silence, and in silence was he gazed
at. The apparition continued a sufficient time in
the chair to convince all present of the reality of
the vision: at length, he arose, and stalked towards
the door, which he opened as if living&mdash;went out,
and then shut the door after him. After a long
pause, some one, at last, had the resolution to say,
"If only one of us had seen this, he would not
have been believed; but it is impossible that so
many persons can be deceived."</p>

<p>The company, by degrees, recovered their
speech; and the whole conversation, as may be
imagined, was upon the dreadful object which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
engaged their attention. They broke up, and went
home. In the morning, inquiry was made after
their sick friend; it was answered by an account
of his death, which happened nearly at the time of
his appearing in the club. There could be little
doubt before, but now nothing could be more certain,
than the reality of the apparition, which had
been seen by so many persons together.</p>

<p>It is needless to say, that such a story spread
over the country, and found credit, even from infidels;
for, in this case, all reasoning became superfluous,
when opposed to a plain fact, attested by
three-and-twenty witnesses. To assert the doctrine
of the fixed laws of nature, was ridiculous,
when there were so many people of credit to prove
that they might be unfixed. Years rolled on; the
story ceased to engage attention, and it was forgotten,
unless when occasionally produced to
silence an unbeliever.</p>

<p>One of the club was an apothecary. In the
course of his practice, he was called to an old woman,
whose profession was attending on sick persons.
She told him, that she could leave the world
with a quiet conscience, but for one thing which lay
on her mind. "Do not you remember Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
whose ghost has been so much talked of? I was
his nurse. The night he died, I left the room for
something that was wanted. I am sure I had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
been absent long; but, at my return, I found the
bed without my patient. He was delirious; and I
feared that he had thrown himself out of the window.
I was so frightened that I had no power to
stir; but, after some time, to my great astonishment,
he entered the room shivering, and his
teeth chattering&mdash;laid down on the bed, and
died. Considering myself as the cause of his
death, I kept this a secret, for fear of what might
be done to me. Though I could contradict all
the story of the ghost, I dared not do it. I
knew, by what had happened, that it was he
himself who had been in the club-room (perhaps
recollecting, in his delirium, that it was the
night of meeting): but I hope God and the
poor gentleman's friends will forgive me, and then
I shall die contented."</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
LUNATIC APPARITION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> celebrated historian De Thou had a very
singular adventure at Saumer, in the year 1598.
One night, having retired to rest, very much
fatigued, while he was enjoying a sound sleep, he
felt a very extraordinary weight upon his feet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which, having made him turn suddenly, fell down
and awakened him. At first he imagined that it
had been only a dream: but, hearing soon after
some noise in the chamber, he drew aside the curtains,
and saw, by the help of the moon (which at
that time shone very bright), a large white figure
walking up and down; and, at the same time, observed
upon a chair some rags, which he thought
belonged to thieves who had come to rob him.
The figure then approaching his bed, he had
the courage to ask it what it was. "I am,"
said it, "the <i>Queen of Heaven</i>." Had such a
figure appeared to any credulous ignorant man
in the dead of night, and made such a speech,
would he not have trembled with fear, and have
frightened the whole neighbourhood with a marvellous
description of it? But De Thou had too
much understanding to be so imposed upon.
Upon hearing the words which dropped from the
figure, he immediately concluded that it was some
mad woman, got up, called his servants, and ordered
them to turn her out of doors; after which
he returned to bed, and fell asleep. Next morning
he found that he had not been deceived in his conjecture;
and that, having forgot to shut his door,
this female figure had escaped from her keepers,
and entered his apartment. The brave Schomberg,
to whom De Thou related this adventure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
some days after, confessed, that in such a case he
should not have shewn so much courage. The
King also, who was informed of it by Schomberg,
made the same acknowledgment.</p>

<h2><span class="sm">SUPPOSED</span><br />
SUPERNATURAL APPEARANCE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> few years since, before ghosts and spectres
were commonly introduced among us by means of
the pantomimes and novels of the day, a gentleman
of a philosophical turn of mind, who was hardy
enough to deny the existence of any thing supernatural,
happened to pay a visit at an old house in
Gloucestershire, whose unfortunate owner had
just become a bankrupt, with a view to offer such
assistance and consolation as he could bestow:
when, in one rainy dull evening in the month of
March, the family being seated by the kitchen
fire-side, the conversation turned on supernatural
appearances. The philosopher was endeavouring
to convince his auditors of the folly and absurdity
of such opinions, with rather an unbecoming levity,
when the wife left the party and went up stairs;
but had hardly quitted the kitchen three minutes,
before a dreadful noise was heard, mingled with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
horrid screams. The poor maid changed countenance,
and her red hair stood erect, in every direction;
the husband trembled in his chair; and
the philosopher began to look serious. At last,
the husband rose from his seat, and ascended the
stairs in search of his wife, when a second dreadful
scream was heard: the maid mustered resolution
to follow her master, and a third scream ensued.
The philosopher, who was not quite at ease, now
thought it high time for him to set out in search
of a <i>cause</i>: when, arriving at the landing-place,
he found the maid in a fit; the master lying flat,
with his face upon the floor, which was stained
with blood; and, on advancing a little farther, the
mistress in nearly the same condition. To the
latter the philosopher paid immediate attention;
and, finding she had only swooned away, brought
her in his arms down stairs, and placed her on the
floor of the kitchen. The pump was at hand, and
he had the presence of mind to run to it to get
some water in a glass; but what was his astonishment,
when he found that he pumped only copious
streams of blood! which extraordinary appearance,
joined to the other circumstances, made the
unbeliever tremble in every limb: a sudden perspiration
overspread the surface of his skin; and
the supernatural possessed his imagination in all its
true colours of dread and horror. Again and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
again he repeated his efforts; and, again and
again, threw away the loathsome contents of the
glass.</p>

<p>Had the story stopped here, what would not
superstition have made of it? But the philosopher,
who was still pumping, now found the water grew
paler; and, at last, pure water filled the vessel.
Overjoyed at this observation, he threw the limpid
stream in the face of the mistress, whose recovery
was assisted by the appearance of her husband and
Betty.</p>

<p>The mystery, when explained, turned out to be
simply this&mdash;The good housewife, when she knew
that a docket had been struck against her husband,
had taken care to conceal some of her choice
cherry brandy, from the rapacious gripe of the
messenger to the Commissioners of Bankrupts, on
some shelves in a closet up stairs, which also
contained, agreeably to the ancient architecture
of the building, the trunk of the pump below;
and, in trying to move the jars, to get at a drop for
the party at the kitchen fire, the shelf gave way
with a tremendous crash; the jars were broken into
an hundred pieces; the rich juice descended in
torrents down the trunk of the pump, and filled,
with its ruby current, the sucker beneath; and
this was the self-same fluid which the philosopher,
in his fright, had so madly thrown away. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
wife had swooned at the accident; the husband,
in his haste, had fallen on his nose, which ran with
blood; and the maid's legs, in her hurry, coming
in contact with her fallen master's ribs, she, like
"vaulting ambition," overleaped herself, and fell
on the other side.</p>

<p>Often has this story been told, by one who knew
the philosopher, with great effect, till the last act,
or <i>denouement</i>; when disappointment was mostly
visible in the looks of his auditors, at finding there
was actually nothing supernatural in the affair,
and no ghost.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
APPARITION INVESTIGATED.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a village in one of the midland counties of
Scotland, lived a widow, distinguished among her
neighbours for decency of manners, integrity, and
respect for religion. She affirmed that, for several
nights together, she had heard a supernatural
voice exclaiming aloud, <i>Murder! Murder!</i> This
was immediately reported through the neighbourhood:
all were alarmed, and looked around them
with solicitude for the detection of the murder
which they supposed to have been committed;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and it was not long till a discovery seemed actually
to be made. It was reported, that a gentleman,
who had relations at no great distance, and
had been residing in the West Indies, had lately
arrived with a considerable fortune; that he had
lodged at an inn about three miles off; and that
he had afterwards been seen entering a house in
the village where the widow lived, from which he
had never returned. It was next affirmed, that a
tradesman, passing the church-yard about twelve
at midnight, had seen four men carry a dead
corpse into that cemetery.</p>

<p>These three facts being joined together, seemed
perfectly to agree, and to confirm one another;
and all believed some horrible murder had been
committed. The relations of the gentleman
thought they were called upon to make inquiry
into the truth of these allegations: they accordingly
came first to the church-yard, where, in
company with the sexton, they examined all the
graves with great care, in order to discover whether
any of them had lately been dug, or had the
appearance of containing more than one coffin.
But this search was to no purpose, for no alteration
had been made upon the graves. It was
next reported, that the murdered man had been
buried in a plantation about a mile distant from
the village. As the alarm was now very general,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a number of the inhabitants proposed, of their
own accord, to explore it. They accordingly
spread themselves over the wood, and searched
it with care; but no grave, or new-dug earth, was
found.</p>

<p>The matter did not rest here. The person
who was said to have seen four men carry a dead
corpse into the church-yard at midnight, was
summoned to appear before a meeting of the
justices of the peace. Upon examination, he denied
any knowledge of the affair; but referred
the court to another person, from whom he had
received his information. This person was examined,
and the result was the same as the former.
In short, one person had heard it from another,
who had received it from a third, who had heard
it from a fourth; but it had received a little embellishment
from every person who repeated it:
it turned out to be the same with Smollett's story
of the three black crows, which somebody was
said to have vomited.</p>

<p>Upon inquiry at the inn, where it was said the
West-India gentleman had lodged, no such gentleman
had been seen there; and it was found afterwards,
he had never left the West Indies.</p>

<p>Still, however, the veracity of the widow was
not disputed; and some dark and secret transaction
was suspected. But the whole affair was at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
length explained, by discovering that she was
somewhat deranged by melancholy; and the cries
which she at first imagined she had heard, were
afterwards imitated by some roguish person, who
was highly amused with spreading terror among
the credulous.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
BENIGHTED TRAVELLER,<br />
<span class="xsm">AND</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>HAUNTED ROOM</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> was benighted, while travelling
alone, in a remote part of the highlands of Scotland,
and was compelled to ask shelter for the
evening at a small lonely hut. When he was conducted
to his bed-room, the landlady observed,
with mysterious reluctance, that he would find
the window very insecure. On examination, part
of the wall appeared to have been broken down,
to enlarge the opening.</p>

<p>After some inquiry, he was told, that a pedlar,
who had lodged in the room a short time before,
had committed suicide, and was found hanging
behind the door in the morning. According to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the superstition of the country, it was deemed
improper to remove the body through the door
of the house; and to convey it through the window
was impossible, without removing part of
the wall. Some hints were dropped, that the
room had been subsequently haunted by the poor
man's spirit.</p>

<p>The gentleman laid his arms, properly prepared
against intrusion of any kind, by the bed-side,
and retired to rest, not without some degree
of apprehension. He was visited, in a
dream, by a frightful apparition; and, awaking in
agony, found himself sitting up in bed, with a
pistol grasped in his right hand. On casting a
fearful glance round the room, he discovered, by
the moonlight, a corpse, dressed in a shroud,
reared erect against the wall, close by the window.
With much difficulty, he summoned up
resolution to approach the dismal object, the
features of which, and the minutest parts of its
funereal apparel, he perceived distinctly: he
passed one hand over it, felt nothing, and staggered
back to the bed. After a long interval,
and much reasoning with himself, he renewed his
investigation, and at length discovered that the
object of his terror was produced by the moonbeams
forming a long bright image through the
broken window, on which his fancy, impressed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
his dream, had pictured, with mischievous accuracy,
the lineaments of a body prepared for interment.
Powerful associations of terror, in this
instance, had excited the recollected images with
uncommon force and effect.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
SUBTERRANEAN TRAVELLER;<br />
<span class="xsm">OR</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>GHOST AND NO GHOST</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following record is copied verbatim from
an old newspaper&mdash;<cite>The Weekly Journal, or British
Gazetteer.</cite></p>

<p class="ralign">"<i>Bedlam</i>, <i>January</i> 18, 1719.</p>

<p>"It is not long since one of the female inhabitants
of these frantic territories gave the following
occasion for a very pleasing entertainment.
Some bricklayers happened to be at work
here, to repair and clean the passage leading to
the common sewer; who going to dinner, and
leaving the ladder which descended to it, standing,
the said unfortunate inhabitant had a sort
of an odd notion, that the workmen had been
prying into the secrets of the lower world, and
therefore (nobody seeing her) she went down the
ladder which led into the common sewer; and, in
that subterraneous cavern, finding none to control
or stop her passage, she travelled, with great pleasure
and curiosity, till she came to <i>Tokenhouse
Yard</i>, which is near half a mile. There it happened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>that a couple of young females, coming to
the vault, heard a noise below, crying, '<i>Who the
plague are ye? What d'ye make that noise for?
What, is the devil in ye?</i>' Upon which, away flew
the women, not staying to look behind them; and
coming half-frightened into the house, said, the
devil was in the vault. Accordingly, more company
going, they still heard the same noise. Upon
which they called out, and asked, '<i>Who's there?
What are ye?</i>' '<i>The Devil</i>,' replied the traveller
below. '<i>How came you there?</i>' said they. '<i>Nay,
how the devil know I?</i>' answered the mad-woman.
'<i>Why don't you bring me a candle, that I may
find my way?</i>' Finding it certain to be a human
voice, they feared somebody might accidentally
have fallen in, and therefore they immediately
went to work, to deliver the poor wretch from her
suffocating thraldom, and found her a lamentable
spectacle; so that they began to question her how
she came there, and where she lived. She answered
<i>that she was going to Hell, but had lost her way;
that there were several in her company, who had
got thither, and the gate was shut upon them;
that she had lost her way, but should overtake
them by and by</i>. These wild expressions made
some of them fancy she was a mad-woman; and,
after some consideration, they resolved to bring
her hither; when she was presently owned, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the people that brought her let us into the story:
but her head still runs on her journey, and she
talks of little else."</p>

<h2>THE MILKMAN<br />
<span class="xsm">AND</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>CHURCH-YARD GHOST</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> much addicted to the heinous sin of
drunkenness, in coming home late one winter's
night, had to cross Stepney church-yard; where,
close to the foot path, a deep grave had been
opened the day before. He, being very drunk,
staggered into the grave; it was a great mercy he
did not break his neck, or any of his limbs; but, as
it rained hard all night, and the grave was so deep
that he could not got out, he had but an uncomfortable
bed. For some hours nobody passed by;
till, shortly after the clock had struck four, a milkman,
who had been to the cow-house for his milk,
came by, and said to himself, "I wonder what
o'clock it is." The man in the grave hallooed
out, "Just gone four." The milkman seeing nobody,
immediately conceived a ghost from one
of the graves had answered him, and took to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
heels with such rapidity, that when he reached an
ale-house he was ready to faint; and, what added
to his trouble, in running, he so jumbled his pails
as to spill great part of his milk. The people who
heard his relation, believed it must have been a
ghost that had answered him. The tale went round,
and would have been credited, perhaps, till now,
had not the drunkard, sitting one day in the very
alehouse the milkman had stopped at, on hearing
the story repeated, with a hearty laugh acknowledged
himself to be the ghost, and that he had
much enjoyed the jumbling of the man's pails, as
he ran away, and the loss which it occasioned him.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
UNFORTUNATE PRIEST,<br />
<span class="xsm">AND</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>DEAD BODY</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a province of Prussia, a man being dead, was
carried, as is customary, into the church, the
evening previous to the day of his interment. It
is usual to place the corpse in an open coffin; and
a priest, attended only by a boy of the choir, remains
all night praying by the side of the dead
body, and on the following day the friends of the
deceased come to close up the coffin, and inter the
corpse. On this occasion, after the evening service
had been performed, every one retired from the
church: and the priest, with the young chorister,
withdrew to supper; but soon returned, and the
former commenced the usual prayers. What was
his astonishment, when he beheld the dead body
rise from the coffin, and advance towards him.
Terrified in the extreme, the priest flew to the
font; and, conjuring the corpse to return to its
proper station, showered holy water on him in
abundance. But the obstinate and evil-minded
spirit, disregarding the power of holy water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
seized the unfortunate priest, threw him to the
ground, and soon, by repeated blows, left him
extended, without life, on the pavement. Having
committed this act of barbarity, he appeared to
return quietly to his coffin. On the following
morning, the persons who came to prepare for the
funeral, found the priest murdered, and the corpse,
as before, in the coffin. Nothing could throw any
light on this extraordinary event but the testimony
of the boy, who had concealed himself on the first
movement of the dead body, and who persisted
in declaring, that he saw from his hiding-place the
priest killed by the corpse. Conjecture, and endeavours
to discover the truth, were alike vain,
tormenting, and fruitless. Many resources were
tried; for it was not every one that submitted
themselves to the belief of a dead body rising to
kill a priest, and then quietly resigning itself to
the place of its consignment. Many years afterwards,
a malefactor, condemned to death for various
crimes, and brought to the torture, confessed,
that having (for some unknown reason) conceived
an implacable hatred against the priest in question,
he had formed the design of thus avenging himself.
Having found means to remain in the church,
he seized the moment of the priest's retiring to
supper, withdrew the dead body from the coffin,
and placed himself in its stead, in the shroud and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
other appurtenances. After executing the murder
of the priest, he returned the corpse to its place,
and got unperceived out of the church, when the
friends of the deceased came in the morning to
attend the funeral.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
FLOATING WONDER,<br />
<span class="xsm">OR</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>FEMALE SPECTRE</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bridge over the river Usk, near Caerleon, in
Wales, is formed of wood, and very curiously
constructed, the tide rising occasionally to the almost
incredible height of fifty or sixty feet. The
boards which compose the flooring of this bridge
being designedly loose, in order to float with the
tide, when it exceeds a certain height, are prevented
from escaping only by little pegs at the end
of them; which mode of fastening does not afford
a very safe footing for the traveller, and some
awkward accidents have been known to arise from
this cause. The following singular adventure occurred
about twenty years since to a female of the
neighbourhood, as she was passing it at night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p><p>The heroine in question was a Mrs. Williams,
who had been to spend a cheerful evening at a
neighbour's house on the eastern side of the river,
and was returning home at a decent hour. The
night being extremely dark, she had provided herself
with a lanthorn and candle, by the assistance of
which she found her way to the bridge, and had
already passed part of the dangerous structure,
when she unfortunately trod on a plank that had
by some accident lost the tenons originally fixed to
the ends of it, and had slipped from its proper
situation; the faithless board yielded to the weight
of the good lady, who was rather corpulent, and
carried her through the flooring, with her candle
and lanthorn, into the river. Fortunately, at the
moment of falling, she was standing in such a position,
as gave her a seat on the plank similar to
that of a horseman on his nag. It may be easily
imagined, that Mrs. Williams must have been
dreadfully alarmed at this change of situation, as
well as the difference of element. Blessed, however,
with great presence of mind, and a patient
endurance of evil, the good lady was not overwhelmed
by her fall, but steadily maintained her
seat on the board; taking care, at the same time,
to preserve her candle lighted, rightly supposing
it would serve as a guide to any one who might
be able or willing to assist her. Thus bestriding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the plank, our heroine was hurried down the river
towards Newport, the bridge of which, she trusted,
would stop her progress, or that she might alarm
the inhabitants with her cries. In both her hopes,
however, she was disappointed: the rapidity of a
spring tide sent her through the arch with the velocity
of an arrow discharged from a bow, and the
good people of the town had long been wrapped
in slumber. Thus situated, her prospect became
each moment more desperate; her candle was
nearly extinguished! and every limb so benumbed
with cold, that she had the greatest difficulty in
<i>keeping her saddle</i>. Already she had reached the
mouth of the Usk, and was on the point of encountering
the turbulent waves of the British Channel,
when the master of a fishing-boat, who was returning
from his nightly toils, discovered the gleaming
of her taper, and bearing her calls for assistance,
though he at first thought her a witch, yet ventured
to approach this floating wonder, and happily
succeeded in rescuing Mrs. Williams from a
watery grave, and bringing her in safety to the
shore in his boat.</p>

<p>Thus was the life of a fellow-creature preserved
by a poor fisherman's courage, in not being daunted
by what he at first conceived a mysterious light
proceeding from some sprite or hobgoblin; but,
from duly examining into causes, proved himself
both a hero and friend.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">A</span><br />
MAN WITH HIS HEAD ON FIRE,<br />
<span class="sm">AND COVERED WITH BLOOD</span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following singular adventure is related by a
military captain.</p>

<p>"I was coming home one night on horseback,
from a visit I had been making to a number of the
neighbouring villages, where I had quartered my
recruits. It happened there had fallen a deal of
rain that day, since noon, and during all the evening,
which had broken up the roads, and it was
raining still with equal violence; but, being forced
to join my company next morning, I set out, provided
with a lanthorn, having to pass a strait
defile between two mountains. I had cleared it,
when a gust of wind took off my hat, and carried
it so far, that I despaired of getting it again, and
therefore gave the matter up. By great good fortune,
I had with me my red cloak. I covered my
head and shoulders with it, leaving nothing but
a little hole to see my way, and breathe through;
and, for fear the wind should take a fancy to my
cloak, as well as my hat, I passed my right arm
round my body to secure it: so that, riding on in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
this position, you may easily conceive my lanthorn,
which I held in my right hand, was under my left
shoulder. At the entrance of a village on a hill,
I met three travellers, who no sooner saw me than
they ran away as fast as possible. For my part, I
went on upon the gallop; and when I came into the
town, alighted at an inn, where I designed to rest
myself a little. Soon after, who should enter, but
my three poltroons, as pale as death itself. They
told the landlord and his people, trembling as they
spoke, that in the road they had encountered a
great figure of a man all over blood, whose head
was like a flame of fire, and to increase the wonder,
placed beneath his shoulder. He was mounted
on a dreadful horse, said they, quite black behind,
and grey before; which, notwithstanding it was
lame, he spurred and whipped right up the mountain
with extraordinary swiftness. Here they
ended their relation. They had taken care to
spread the alarm as they were flying from this
wondrous apparition, and the people had come
with them to the inn in such a drove, that upwards
of an hundred were all squeezed together,
opening both their mouths and ears at this tremendous
story. To make up in some sort for my
dismal journey, I resolved to laugh a little, and be
merry at their cost, intending to cure them of such
fright, by shewing them their folly in the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
instance. With this view, I got upon my horse
again, behind the inn, and went round about till I
had rode the distance of a mile or thereabouts;
when, turning, I disposed of my accoutrements,
that is to say, my cloak and lanthorn, as before,
and on I came upon a gallop towards the inn.
You should have seen the frighted mob of peasants,
how they hid their faces at the sight, and
got into the passage. There was no one but the
host had courage to remain, and keep his eye upon
me. I was now before the door, on which I
shifted the position of my lanthorn, let my cloak
drop down upon my shoulders, and appeared the
figure he had seen me by his kitchen fire. It was
not without real difficulty, we could bring the
simple people who had crowded in for safety from
their terror: the three travellers, in particular, as
the first impression was still strong within them,
they could not credit what they saw. We finished
by a hearty laugh at their expence, and by drinking
to the man whose head was like a flame of fire,
and placed beneath his shoulder."</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
INNOCENT DEVIL,<br />
<span class="xsm">OR</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>AGREEABLE DISAPPOINTMENT</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following story is extracted from a letter I
received, some time since, from a friend, on the
subject of apparitions.</p>

<p>"Returning, one evening in the summer, to my
apartments, at a short distance from town, I was
invited by my landlady, a brisk young widow, to
partake of <i>un petit souper</i>, as she termed it. The
invitation, of course, I accepted; and, after a
pleasant repast, the cloth being removed, various
conversation ensued, and the terminating subject
was ghosts and hobgoblins. After my attention
had been greatly excited by many dreadful recitals,
I thought I perceived something black
glide swiftly by my feet. My back at that time
being towards the door, I instantly turned round;
and, perceiving the same to be shut, I fancied my
fear to be only a chimæra arising from the subject
we had been conversing on. I therefore replenished
my glass; and the subject of spectres was
again renewed. In the midst of the discourse,
when I was all attention to some dreadful tale, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
felt something gently brush the bottom of my
chair; when, on looking down, I beheld the most
hideous black figure imagination can conceive.
It was a monster on all fours, with cloven feet,
horns on its head, and a long tail trailing after it
as it moved along. My terror, I will acknowledge,
was so great, that I instantly jumped up as high as
the table, and loudly vociferated, 'Lord have
mercy upon me! what is it?' My friendly hostess
now begged me to sit down and be a little calm,
and she would explain to me the cause of my
alarm. The figure having again disappeared, the
lady of the ceremonies thus addressed me&mdash;'I
beg your pardon, Sir, for the fright I have thus
occasioned you. It is only a little joke I have
been playing off, merely to see whether you were
proof against supernatural appearances. A friend
of mine having been to a masqued ball in a
domino, I prepared the stratagem, by making a
head-piece to the dress, with horns, false legs,
cloven feet, and a tail. I then instructed my servant,
who was by agreement to be in the adjoining
room, on hearing a certain part of my story, to
open the door as softly as possible, and to make
her <i>entré</i>, in this habiliment. This she attempted
before the plot was sufficiently ripe, when you
turned round towards the door, and she retreated.
The second attempt too effectually succeeded; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which I again ask your pardon, and am extremely
sorry, though luckily it has had no bad effect.
But I will never, while I live, again be induced to
act so foolishly.'&mdash;"</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
SPECTRE OF THE BROKEN.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following observations on that singular phenomenon
called the Spectre of the Broken, in Germany,
is related by Monsieur J. L. Jordan, in the
following words.</p>

<p>"In the course of my repeated tours through
the Harz (mountains in Germany), I ascended the
Broken twelve times: but I had the good fortune
only twice (both times about Whitsuntide) to see
that atmospheric phenomenon called the Spectre
of the Broken, which appears to me so worthy of
particular attention, as it must, no doubt, be observed
on other high mountains, which have a
situation favourable for producing it. The first
time I was deceived by this extraordinary phenomenon,
I had clambered up to the summit of the
Broken very early in the morning, in order to wait
for the inexpressibly beautiful view of the sun
rising in the east. The heavens were already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
streaked with red; the sun was just appearing
above the horizon in full majesty; and the most
perfect serenity prevailed throughout the surrounding
country; when the other Harz mountains
in the south-west, towards the Worm mountains,
&amp;c. lying under the Broken, began to
be covered by thick clouds. Ascending at that
moment the granite rocks called the Tempelskanzel,
there appeared before me, though at a great
distance, towards the Worm mountains and the
Auchtermanshohe, the gigantic figure of a man,
as if standing on a large pedestal. But scarcely
had I discovered it, when it began to disappear;
the clouds sunk down speedily, and expanded;
and I saw the phenomenon no more. The second
time, however, I saw this spectre somewhat
more distinctly, a little below the summit of the
Broken, and near the Heinnichshohe, as I was
looking at the sun-rising, about four o'clock in the
morning. The weather was rather tempestuous;
the sky towards the level country was pretty clear;
but the Harz mountains had attracted several
thick clouds which had been hovering round them,
and which, beginning on the Broken, confined the
prospect. In these clouds, soon after the rising
of the sun, I saw my own shadow, of a monstrous
size, move itself, for a couple of seconds, in the
clouds; and the phenomenon disappeared. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
impossible to see this phenomenon, except when
the sun is at such an altitude as to throw his rays
upon the body in an horizontal direction; for if
he is higher, the shadow is thrown rather under
the body than before it.</p>

<p>"In the month of September, last year, as I was
making a tour through the Harz with a very agreeable
party, and ascended the Broken, I found an
excellent account and explanation of this phenomenon,
as seen by M. Haue on the 23d of May
1797, in his diary of an excursion to that mountain;
I shall therefore take the liberty of transcribing
it.</p>

<p>"'After having been here for the thirtieth time,'
says M. Haue; 'and, besides other objects of my attention,
having procured information respecting the
above-mentioned atmospheric phenomenon, I was
at length so fortunate as to have the pleasure of
seeing it; and, perhaps, my description may afford
satisfaction to others who visit the Broken through
curiosity. The sun rose about four o'clock; and,
the atmosphere being quite serene towards the
east, his rays could pass without any obstruction
over the Heinnichshohe. In the south-west, however,
towards the Auchtermaunshohe, a brisk west
wind carried before it their transparent vapours,
which were not yet condensed into thick heavy
clouds. About a quarter past four I went towards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>the inn, and looked round to see whether
the atmosphere would permit me to have a free
prospect to the south-west; when I observed, at a
very great distance, towards the Auchtermaunshohe,
a human figure, of a monstrous size. A
violent gust of wind having almost carried away
my hat, I clapped my hand to it by moving my
arm towards my head, and the colossal figure did
the same. The pleasure which I felt on this discovery
can hardly be described; for I had already
walked many a weary step in the hope of seeing
this shadowy image, without being able to satisfy
my curiosity. I immediately made another movement
by bending my body, and the colossal figure
before me repeated it. I was desirous of doing
the same thing once more; but my colossus had
vanished. I remained in the same position, waiting
to see whether it would return; and, in a few
minutes, it again made its appearance in the Auchtermaunshohe.
I paid my respects to it a second
time, and it did the same to me. I then called
the landlord of the Broken; and, having both
taken the same position which I had taken alone,
we looked towards the Auchtermaunshohe, but saw
nothing. We had not, however, stood long, when
two such colossal figures were formed over the
above eminence, which repeated our compliment,
by bending their bodies as we did; after which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
vanished. We retained our position, kept our
eyes fixed upon the same spot; and, in a little
time, the two figures again stood before us, and
were joined by a third. Every movement that we
made by bending our bodies, these figures imitated;
but with this difference, that the phenomenon
was sometimes weak and faint, sometimes
strong and well-defined. Having thus had an opportunity
of discovering the whole secret of this
phenomenon, I can give the following information
to such of my readers as may be desirous of seeing
it themselves. When the rising sun (and, according
to analogy, the case will be the same at the
setting sun) throws his rays over the Broken upon
the body of a man standing opposite to fine light
clouds floating around or hovering past him, he
needs only fix his eye stedfastly upon them, and
in all probability he will see the singular spectacle
of his own shadow extending to the length of five
or six hundred feet, at the distance of about two
miles from him. This is one of the most agreeable
phenomena I have ever had an opportunity
of remarking on the great observations of Germany.'&mdash;"</p>

<h2>SIR HUGH ACKLAND.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following remarkable fact shews the necessity
of minutely examining people after death,
prior to interment, and of not giving way to ridiculous
fears about supernatural appearances.</p>

<p>The late Sir Hugh Ackland, of Devonshire, apparently
died of a fever, and was laid out as dead.
The nurse, with two of the footmen, sat up with
the corpse; and Lady Ackland sent them a bottle
of brandy to drink in the night. One of the servants,
being an arch rogue, told the other, that
his master dearly loved brandy when he was alive;
"and," says he, "I am resolved he shall drink
one glass with us now he is dead." The fellow,
accordingly, poured out a bumper of brandy, and
forced it down his throat. A gurgling immediately
ensued, and a violent motion of the neck
and upper part of the breast. The other footman
and the nurse were so terrified, that they ran down
stairs; and the brandy genius, hastening away
with rather too much speed, tumbled down stairs
head foremost. The noise of the fall, and his
cries, alarmed a young gentleman who slept in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the house that night; who got up, and went to the
room where the corpse lay, and, to his great surprise,
saw Sir Hugh sitting upright. He called
the servants; Sir Hugh was put into a warm bed,
and the physician and apothecary sent for. These
gentlemen, in a few weeks, perfectly restored their
patient to health, and he lived several years afterwards.</p>

<p>The above story is well known to the Devonshire
people; as in most companies Sir Hugh
used to tell this strange circumstance, and talk of
his resurrection by his brandy footman, to whom
(when he really died) he left a handsome annuity.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">AN</span><br />
AGREEABLE EXPLANATION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of undoubted veracity relates
the following story.</p>

<p>"When I was a young man, I took up my residence
at a lodging-house, which was occupied
by several families. On taking possession of my
apartments, I agreed with the old lady of the
house, who had two children, to accommodate
me with a key to the street-door, to prevent unnecessary
trouble to the servant or family, as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
should very frequently stay out late in the evening.
This was agreed to; and, by way of making
things more agreeable, I had always a light left
burning for me on the staircase, which was opposite
to the outer door. This arrangement being
made, things continued very comfortable for some
months; till, one night, or rather morning, returning
and opening the door as usual, I thought I
heard a faint scream&mdash;I paused for a few seconds.
The cry of 'Murder!' now feebly succeeded. I
hesitated how to act, when the cry of 'Murder!'
was again more loudly vociferated. This very
much alarmed me; and, instead of going forward,
I instantly re-opened the street-door, and was in
the act of calling the watch, when a tall spare
figure, at least six feet high, in a complete white
dress, and pointed cap, with a candle in its hand,
appeared before me. This unexpected encounter
completed my astonishment, and I was about to
speak, when the phantom (which proved to be my
good old landlady) thus addressed me&mdash;'I hope,
Sir, I have not alarmed you; but, just before you
came to the door, I had a most frightful dream. I
thought robbers had broken into my house, and, not
content with plunder, had murdered my children,
and were about to destroy me; when the noise
you made on opening the door increased my
agony of mind; and, before I was sufficiently sensible,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
I screamed out <i>Murder!</i> as you must have
heard.' This explanation having taken place, the
poor woman retired, and was for several days after
extremely ill; and I was not a little pleased myself
at finding what I at first supposed a supernatural
encounter thus terminate, without having recourse
to a divine exorcist."</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
SOMERSETSHIRE DEMONIAC.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 13th of June 1788, George Lukins, of
Yatton, in Somersetshire, was exorcised in the
Temple Church at Bristol, and delivered from the
possession of seven devils by the efforts of seven
clergymen.</p>

<p>Lukins was first attacked by a kind of epileptic
fit, when he was going about acting Christmas
plays, or mummeries: this he ascribed to a blow
given by an invisible hand. He was afterwards
seized by fits; during which he declared with a
roaring voice that he was the devil, and sung different
songs in a variety of keys. The fits always
began and ended with a strong agitation of the
right hand; he frequently uttered dreadful execrations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>during the fits: and the whole duration of
this disorder was eighteen years.</p>

<p>At length, <i>viz.</i> in June 1788, he declared, that
he was possessed by seven devils, and could only be
freed by the prayers, <i>in faith</i>, of seven clergymen.
Accordingly, the requisite number was summoned,
and the patient sung, swore, laughed, barked, and
treated the company with a ludicrous parody on
the <i>Te Deum</i>. These astonishing symptoms resisted
both hymns and prayers, till a <i>small, faint
voice</i> admonished the ministers to adjure. The
spirits, after some murmuring, yielded to the adjuration;
and the happy patient returned thanks
for his wonderful cure. It is remarkable, that,
during this solemn mockery, the fiend swore, by
his infernal den, that he would not quit his patient;
an oath, I believe, no where to be found
but in the Pilgrim's Progress, from whence Lukins
probably got it.</p>

<p>Very soon after, the first relation of this story
was published, a person well acquainted with Lukins,
took the trouble of undeceiving the public,
with regard to his pretended disorder, in a plain,
sensible, narrative of his conduct. He asserts,
that Lukins's first seizure was nothing else than a
fit of drunkenness; that he always foretold his
fits, and remained sensible during their continuance.
That he frequently saw Lukins in his fits;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in every one of which, except in singing, he performed
not more than most active young people
can easily do. That he was detected in an imposture
with respect to the clenching of his hands.
That after money had been collected for him, he
got very suddenly well. That he never had any
fits while he was at St. George's Hospital, in
London; nor when visitors were excluded from
his lodgings by desire of the author of the narrative:
and that he was particularly careful never
to hurt himself by his exertions during the
paroxysm.</p>

<p>Is it for the credit of this philosophical age,
that so bungling an imposture should deceive
seven clergymen into a public act of exorcism?
This would not have passed even on the authors
of the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>; for they required
signs of supernatural agency, such as the suspension
of the possessed in the air without any visible
support, or the use of different languages, unknown
to the demoniac in his natural state.</p>

<h2>THE MANIAC,<br />
<span class="xsm">OR</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>FATAL EFFECTS OF WANTON MISCHIEF</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago, a very intelligent, handsome,
and promising youth, whose names is Henry Pargeter
Lewis, the son of a respectable attorney, in
the town of Dudley, was placed for a probationary
time, previously to an intended apprenticeship,
with a surgeon and apothecary of the name
of Powell, in the immediate neighbourhood of
one of our great public schools. He had not been
there long, before one of the scholars, who
lodged at the surgeon's, in league with the servant-boy
of the house, devised the following stratagem
to frighten him. One night, during an absence
of the master, the servant-boy concealed
himself under the bed of Henry, before the latter
retired to rest, and remained there till the hour
of midnight; when, on a preconcerted signal of
three raps at the chamber door, it suddenly
opened, and in stalked the school-boy, habited in
a white sheet, with his face horribly disguised,
and bearing a lighted candle in his hand; the
servant-boy, at the same moment, heaving up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the bed under Henry with his back. How long
this was acted is not known: it was done long
enough, however, completely to dethrone the reason
of the unfortunate youth; who, it is supposed,
immediately covered himself with the bed-clothes,
and so continued till the morning. On his not
rising at the usual time, some one of the family
went to call him; and, not answering, except by
incoherent cries, was discovered in the state just
described.</p>

<p>The melancholy tidings of his situation were
conveyed to his friends, on his removal to them;
the facts having been disclosed, partly by the
confession of the servant-boy, and partly by the
unfortunate youth himself, during the few lucid
intervals which occurred in the course of the
first year after his misfortune.</p>

<p>His father and mother were then living, but
they are now both dead: and the little property
they left to support him is now nearly exhausted,
together with a small subscription which was also
raised to furnish him with necessaries, and to remunerate
a person to take care of him. He is
perfectly harmless and gentle, being rather in a
state of idiotcy than insanity; seldom betraying
any symptoms of violent emotion, except occasionally
about midnight (the time of his unhappy
disaster), when, full of indescribable terror, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
exclaims, "<i>Oh! they are coming! they are
coming!</i>" All hope of recovery is at an end;
more than twenty years having elapsed since the
catastrophe happened.</p>

<p>It is sincerely hoped that this pitiable case may
prove a warning to inconsiderate youth; by showing
them what dreadful effects may follow such
wanton acts of mischief.</p>

<h2><span class="sm">EXTRAORDINARY</span><br />
DOUBLE DREAM,<br />
<span class="sm"><i>Without any Corresponding Event</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Reverend Mr. Joseph Wilkins, a dissenting
clergyman, at Weymouth, in Dorsetshire,
had the following remarkable dream, which is
copied verbatim from a short account of his
life.</p>

<p>"One night, soon after I was in bed, I fell
asleep, and dreamed I was going to London. I
thought it would not be much out of my way to
go through Gloucestershire, and call upon my
friends there. Accordingly, I set out; but remember
nothing that happened by the way, till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
I came to my father's house, when I went to the
fore door and tried to open it, but found it fast;
then I went to our back door, which I opened
and went in: but finding all the family were in
bed, I went across the rooms only, and walked
up stairs, entered the room where my father and
mother were in bed, and as I passed by the side
of the bed in which my father lay, I found him
asleep, or thought he was so; then I went to the
other side, and as I just turned the foot of the
bed, I found my mother awake, to whom I said
these words, 'Mother, I am going a long journey,
and am come to bid you good-bye;' upon which
she answered me in a fright&mdash;'<i>O! dear son, thee
art dead!</i>' with which I awoke, and took no notice
of it more than a common dream, only it
appeared to me very perfect, as sometimes dreams
will. But, in a few days after, as soon as a letter
could reach me, I received one by the post from
my father; upon the receipt of which I was a little
surprised, and concluded something extraordinary
must have happened, as it was but a little before I
had had a letter from my friends, and all were well:
but, upon opening it, I was still more surprised;
for my father addressed me as though I was dead,
desiring me, if alive, or whose ever hands the
letter might fall into, to write immediately. But,
if the letter found me living, they concluded I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
should not live long, and gave this as a reason for
their fears&mdash;That on such a night (naming it), after
they were in bed, my father asleep and my mother
awake, she heard somebody try to open the fore
door, but finding it fast, he went to the back
door, which he opened, and came in, and went
directly through the room up stairs, and she
perfectly knew it to be my step, come to
her bed-side, and spoke to her these words,
'Mother, I am going a long journey, and am
come to bid you good-bye,' upon which she
answered in a fright, '<i>O! dear son, thee art dead!</i>'
(which were the very circumstances and words of
<i>my</i> dream); but she heard nothing more, she saw
nothing (neither did I in my dream, as it was all
dark). Upon this she awoke my father, and told
him what had passed, but he endeavoured to appease
her, persuading her it was only a dream;
but she insisted on it, it was no dream, for that
she was as perfectly awake as ever, and had not had
the least inclination to sleep since she had been in
bed (from which I am apt to think it was at the
<i>very same instant</i> with my dream, though the
distance between us was about one hundred miles,
but of this I cannot speak positively). This affair
happened whilst I was at the academy at Ottery,
in the county of Devon, and I believe in the year
1754; and at this distance every circumstance is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
very fresh in my mind. I have since had frequent
opportunities of talking over the affair with my
mother, and the whole circumstance was as fresh
upon her mind as it was upon mine. I have often
thought that her sensation as to this matter was
stronger than mine; and, what some may think
strange, I cannot remember any thing remarkable
happened thereon; and that this is only a plain
simple narrative of matter of fact."</p>

<p>The above relation must convince credulous
people how necessary it is, not to place implicit
confidence in dreams, or suffer them to make too
great an impression on the mind, as they are most
frequently merely the result of our waking
thoughts.</p>

<h2><span class="sm">REMARKABLE INSTANCES</span><br />
<span class="xsm">OF THE</span><br />
POWER OF VISION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A shepherd</span> upon one of the mountains in
Cumberland, was suddenly enveloped with a thick
fog or mist, through which every object appeared
so greatly increased in magnitude, that he no
longer knew where he was. In this state of confusion
he wandered in search of some unknown
object, from which he might direct his future<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
steps. Chance, at last, brought this lost shepherd
within sight of what he supposed to be a very
large mansion, which he did not remember ever to
have seen before; but, on his entering this visionary
castle, to inquire his way home, he found it
inhabited by his own family. It was nothing more
than his own cottage. But his organs of sight had
so far misled his mental faculties, that some little
time elapsed before he could be convinced that he
saw real objects. Instances of the same kind of
illusion, though not to the same degree, are not
unfrequent in those mountainous regions.</p>

<p>From these effects of vision, it is evident that
the pupil and the picture of an object within the
eye, increase at the same time.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>The writer of the above account was passing
the Frith of Forth, at Queensferry, near Edinburgh,
one morning when it was extremely foggy.
Though the water is only two miles broad, the
boat did not get within sight of the southern shore
till it approached very near it. He then saw, to
his great surprise, a large perpendicular rock,
where he knew the shore was low and almost flat.
As the boat advanced a little nearer, the rock
seemed to split perpendicularly into portions,
which separated at a little distance from one
another. He next saw these perpendicular divisions
move; and, upon approaching a little nearer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
found it was a number of people, standing on the
beach, waiting the arrival of the ferry-boat.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>The following extract of a letter, from a gentleman
of undoubted veracity, is another curious
instance of the property of vision:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I was a young man, I was, like others,
fond of sporting, and seldom liked to miss a day,
if I could any way go out. From my own house
I set out on foot, and pursued my diversion on a
foggy day; and, after I had been out some time,
the fog or mist increased to so great a degree,
that, however familiar the hedges, trees, &amp;c. were
to me, I lost myself, insomuch that I did not
know whether I was going to or from home. In a
field where I then was, I suddenly discovered what
I imagined was a well known hedge-row, interspersed
with pollard trees, &amp;c. under which I
purposed to proceed homewards; but, to my great
surprise, upon approaching this appearance, I
discovered a row of the plants known by the name
of <i>rag</i>, and by the vulgar, <i>canker weed</i>, growing
on a mere balk, dividing ploughed fields: the
whole height of both could not exceed three feet,
or three feet and a half. It struck me so forcibly
that I shall never forget it; this too in a field
which I knew as well as any man, could know a
field."</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
PHILOSOPHER GASSENDI,<br />
<span class="xsm">AND THE</span><br />
<span class="sm"><i>HAUNTED BED-ROOM</i></span>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of the letters of this celebrated philosopher,
he says, that he was consulted by his friend
and patron the Count d'Alais, governor of Provence,
on a phenomenon that haunted his bed-chamber
while he was at Marseilles on some business
relative to his office. The Count tells Gassendi,
that, for several successive nights, as soon
as the candle was taken away, he and his Countess
saw a luminous spectre, sometimes of an oval,
and sometimes of a triangular form; that it always
disappeared when light came into the room; that
he had often struck at it, but could discover nothing
solid. Gassendi, as a natural philosopher, endeavoured
to account for it; sometimes attributing it
to some defect of vision, or to some dampness of
the room, insinuating that perhaps it might be
sent from Heaven to him, to give him a warning
in due time of something that should happen.
The spectre still continued its visits all the time
that he staid at Marseilles; and some years afterwards,
on their return to Aix, the Countess d'Alais<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
confessed to her husband, that she played him this
trick, by means of one of her women placed under
the bed with a phial of phosphorus, with an intention
to frighten him away from Marseilles, a
place in which she very much disliked to live.</p>

<h2><span class="xsm">THE</span><br />
GHOST ON SHIP-BOARD.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of high respectability in the
navy relates the following story.</p>

<p>"When on a voyage to New York, we had not
been four days at sea, before an occurrence of a
very singular nature broke in upon our quiet.
<i>It was a ghost!</i> One night, when all was still
and dark, and the ship rolling at sea before the
wind, a man sprung suddenly upon deck in his
shirt, his hair erect, his eyes starting from their
sockets, and loudly vociferating he had seen a
ghost. After his horror had a little subsided, we
asked him what he had seen?&mdash;he said, the figure of
a woman dressed in white, with eyes of flaming fire;
that she came to his hammock, and stared him in
the face. This we treated as an idle dream, and
sent the frantic fellow to his bed. The story became
the subject of every one; and the succeeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
night produced half a dozen more terrified men
to corroborate what had happened the first, and
all agreed in the same story, that it was a woman.
This rumour daily increasing, at length came to
the ears of the captain and officers, who were all
equally solicitous to discover the true cause of this
terrific report. I placed myself night by night
beneath the hammocks to watch its appearance,
but all in vain; yet still the appearance was
nightly, as usual, and the horrors and fears of the
people rather daily increased than diminished. A
phantom of this sort rather amused than perplexed
my mind; and when I had given over every idea of
discovering the cause of this strange circumstance,
and the thing began to wear away, I was surprised,
one very dark night, as seated under the boats,
with a stately figure in white stalking along the
deck! The singularity of the event struck my
mind that this must be the very identical ghost
which had of late so much disturbed the ship's
company. I therefore instantly dropped down
from the place I was in, to the deck on which it
appeared, when it passed me immediately very
quickly, turned round, and marched directly forwards.
I followed it closely, through the gallery,
and out at the head-doors, when the figure instantly
disappeared, which very much astonished
me. I then leaped upon the forecastle, and asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of the people who were walking there, if such a
figure had passed them? They replied, No, with
some emotion and pleasure, as I had ever ridiculed
all their reports on this subject. However, this
night-scene between me and the ghost became the
theme of the ensuing day. Nothing particular
transpired till twelve o'clock, when, as the people
were pricking at the tub for their beef, it was
discovered Jack Sutton was missing. The ship's
company was directly mustered, and Jack was no
where to be found. I then inquired of his messmates
the character of the man; and, after a number
of interrogatories, one of them said, that poor
Sutton used to tell him a number of comical jokes
about his walking in his sleep. Now the mystery
was unravelled; and this terrific ghost, which had
so much alarmed all the sailors, now proved to be
the poor unfortunate Jack Sutton, who had walked
overboard in his dream."</p>

<p>The first fellow who spread this report, and
who shewed such signs of horror, was found on
inquiry to be a most flagitious villain, who had
murdered a woman, who he believed always
haunted him, and the appearance of this sleepwalker
confirmed in his mind the ghost of the
murdered fair one; for, in such cases, conscience
is a busy monitor, and ever active to its own pain
and disturbance.</p>

<h2><span class="sm">A REMARKABLE STORY</span><br />
<span class="xsm">OF</span><br />
A GHOST,</h2>

<p class="chapsub"><i>Thrice called for, as an Evidence, in a Court
of Justice</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A farmer</span>, on his return from the market at
Southam, in the county of Warwick, was murdered.
A man went the next morning to his
house, and inquired of the mistress, if her husband
came home the evening before; she replied, No,
and that she was under the utmost anxiety and
terror on that account. "Your terror," added
he, "cannot equal mine; for, last night, as I lay
in bed quite awake, the apparition of your husband
appeared to me, shewed me several ghastly
stabs in his body; told me that he had been murdered
by such a person (naming the man), and his
body thrown into such a marl-pit, which he then
particularly described. The alarm was given,
the pit searched, the body found, and the wounds
answered the description given of them. The
man whom the ghost had accused was apprehended,
and committed, on a violent suspicion of
murder. His trial came on at Warwick, before
the Lord Chief Justice Raymond; when the jury
would have convicted, as rashly as the magistrate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
had committed him, had not the judge checked
them. He addressed himself to them in words to
this purpose&mdash;"I think, Gentlemen, you seem
inclined to lay more stress on the evidence of an
apparition than it will bear. I cannot say that I
give much credit to these kind of stories: but, be
that as it will, we have no right to follow our own
private opinions here. We are now in a court of
law, and must determine according to it; and I
know of no law now in being, which will admit
of the testimony of an apparition: not yet, if it
did, doth the ghost appear to give evidence.
Crier," said he, "call the ghost." Which was
<i>thrice</i> done, to no manner of purpose: it appeared
not. "Gentlemen of the Jury," continued
the Judge, "the prisoner at the bar, as you have
heard by undeniable witnesses, is a man of the
most unblemished character; nor has it appeared
in the course of the examination, that there was
any manner of quarrel or grudge between him and
the party deceased. I do believe him to be perfectly
innocent; and, as there is no evidence
against him, either positive or circumstantial, he
must be acquitted. But, from many circumstances
which have arisen during the trial, I do
strongly suspect that the gentleman who saw the
apparition was himself the murderer: in which case
he might easily ascertain the pit, the wounds, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&amp;c.
without any supernatural assistance; and on suspicion,
I shall think myself justified in committing
him to close custody, till the matter can be fairly
inquired into. This was immediately done, and a
warrant granted for searching his house; when
such strong proofs of guilt appeared against
him, that he confessed the murder: for which he
was executed.</p>

<span class="i0">Now the merry bugle-horn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through the forest sounded far;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The lady watch'd the evening star;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The summer sea was dark and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sky was streak'd with lines of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mist rose grey above the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And low the clouds of amber roll'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The lady on the lofty tow'r<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Watch'd the calm and silent hour.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And while she watch'd, she saw advance<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A ship, with painted streamers gay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw it on the green wave dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And plunge amid the silver spray;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">While from the forest's haunts forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Again she heard the bugle horn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sails were full; the breezes rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The billows curl'd along the shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the day began to close&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The bugle horn was heard no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But, rising from the wat'ry way<br /></span>
<span class="i4">An airy voice was heard to say&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Watch no more the evening star;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Watch no more the billowy sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady, from the holy war,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Trust us, lady; we will be<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Your pilots o'er the stormy sea."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the little bark she view'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Moor'd beside the flinty steep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, upon the foamy flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tranquil breezes seemed to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The moon arose; her silver ray<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Seem'd on the silent deep to play.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now music stole across the main:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It was a sweet but mournful tone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It came a slow and dulcet strain;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It came from where the pale moon shone:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And while it pass'd across the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">More soft and soft it seem'd to be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now on the deck the lady stands.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The vessel steers across the main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It steers towards the Holy Land,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Hark! the black'ning billows play;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hark! the waves the vessel fill:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lower, lower, down we go;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All is dark and still below."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now a flash of vivid light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the rolling deep was seen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the lady saw the knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With doublet rich, of gold and green:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From the sockets of his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A pale and streaming light she spies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now his form transparent stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Smiling with a ghastly mien:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the calm and boundless flood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was like the emerald, bright and green;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And now 'twas of a troubled hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">While "Deeper, deeper," sang the crew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Slow advanced the morning light,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Slow they plough'd the wavy tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, on a cliff of dreadful height,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A castle's lofty tow'r they spied:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The lady heard the sailor-band<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Cry, "Lady, this is Holy Land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Watch no more the glitt'ring spray;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Watch no more the star of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lady, this is Holy Land:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">This castle's lord shall welcome thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then, lady, lady, cheerful be!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the castle-gates they pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now across the spacious square,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cover'd high with dewy grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Trembling steals the lady fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And now <i>the castle's lord</i> was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Clad in a doublet gold and green.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He led her through the Gothic hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With bones and skulls encircled round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, let not this thy soul appal!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He cried, "for this is holy ground."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He led her through the chambers lone,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Mid many a shriek and many a groan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now to the banquet-room they came:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Around a table of black stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She mark'd a faint and vapoury flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the horrid feast it shone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And there, to close the madd'ning sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Unnumber'd spectres met the light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Their teeth were like the brilliant, bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their eyes were blue as sapphire clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bones were of a polish'd white;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gigantic did their ribs appear!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And now the knight the lady led,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And placed her at the table's head!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just now the lady <i>woke</i>:&mdash;for she<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had slept upon the lofty tow'r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dreams of dreadful phantasie<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had fill'd the lonely moonlight hour:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Her pillow was the turret stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And on her breast the pale moon shone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now <i>a real</i> voice she hears:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It was her lover's voice; for he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To calm her bosom's rending fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That night had cross'd the stormy sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"I come," said he, "from Palestine,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To prove myself, <i>sweet Lady, thine</i>."<br /></span>
